This letter Is being sent to even/ entity in Ihe United Slates registered wilh the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to manufacture or distribute controlled substances. The purpose of this lelter Is to reiterate the responsibilities of controlled substance manufacturers and distributors to inform DEA of suspicious orders In accordance wilh 21 CFR 1301.74(b).    In addilion to, and not in lieu of, the general requirement under 21 USC 823, that manufacturers and distributors maintain effective controls against diversion. DEA regulations require all manufacturers and distributors to report suspicious orders of controlled substances. Tills 21 CFR 1301.74(b), specifically requires that s registrant ""design and operate a system to disclose to the registrant suspicious orders of controlled substances."" The regulation clearly indicates that It Is tha sole responsibility of the registrant to design and operate such a system. Accordingly, DEA does not approve or otherwise endorse any specific system for reporting suspicious orders. Past communications with DEA. whether implicit or explicit, that could be construed as approval of a particular system for reporting suspicious orders, should no longer be taken to mean that DEA approves a specific system.    The regulation also requires that the registrant Inform the local DEA Division Office of suspicious orders when discovered by the registrant. Filing a monlhly report ol completed transactions (e.g.. ""excessive purchase report"" or ""high unit purchases') does nol meet the regulatory requirement lo report suspicious orders, Registrants are reminded that their responsibility doss not end merely with the filing of a suspicious order report Registrants must conduct an independent analysis of suspicious orders prior to completing a sala to determine whether Ihe controlled substances are likely to be diverted from legitimate channels. Reporting an order as suspicious will not absolve tha registrant of responsibility if the registrant knew, or should have known, that the controlled substances were being diverted.    The regulation specifically slates that suspicious orders include orders of an unusual size, orders deviating substantially from a normal pattern, and orders of an unusual frequency. These criteria are disjunctive and are nol all Inclusive. For example, if an order deviates subslanlially from a normal pallorn, the size of the order does not matter and tha order should be reported as suspicious. Likewise, a registrant need not welt for a ""normal pattern"" to develop over time before determining whether a particular order Is suspicious. The size of an order alone, whether or nol It deviates from a normal pattern, Is enough to trigger the registrant's responsibility to report the order ss suspicious, The determination of whether an order is suspicious depends not only on the ordering patterns of the particular customer, but also on the patterns of the registrant's customer base and the patterns throughout tha relevant segment of the regulated industry.    Failure to maintain effective controls against diversion is inconsistent with the public interest and may result in the revocation of the registrant's DEA license    DEA can immediately    suspend or revoke    registration for violations of    the Controlled Substances    Act and regulations.

DEA joins the alphabet soup with a record $77.6 million settlement, which includes a $75 million fine (the largest ever under the Controlled Substances Act) and the forfeiture of $2.6 million in profits from illegal sales. Meanwhile, a California court upheld a $42,000 fine against Caremark for acting in ""bad faith"" in a whistleblower lawsuit.    In a statement, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration said the company, ""admitted that it unlawfully sold pseudoephedrine [PSE] to criminals who made methamphetamine.

PagelD #: 127769    DEA Florida Pain Clinic Raids    Florida Sun Sentinel    3:54 p.m. EST. February 23. 2011    Drug investigators raided an untold number of pain clinics from Miami to West Palm Beach on Wednesday,    arresting doctors and clinic owners in the biggest single strike at Florida's pain pill industry. Hundreds of officers from federal, state and local agencies fanned out in an orchestrated sweep that shut down    some of the busiest and best known pain clinics in Broward, Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties, said    officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In Delrav Beach, police arrested Dr. Zvi Harry Perper, the son of Broward Medical Examiner Dr. Joshua Perper, at    Delray Pain Management, 201 N. Swinton Ave. Zvi Perper is listed as the owner of the clinic, which is run by    manager Kenneth Murry, who opened it in early 2009. In Oakland Park, a half dozen medical personnel in scrubs were handcuffed and arrested at a high-volume clinic    called Commercial Medical Group, 291 E. Commercial Blvd. Arrests also were made at by agents raiding 45th Street Medical in Lake Worth, which is owned by Dr. Robert    Elessar, federal officials said. Agents raided many more locations, seizing records as part of ongoing    investigations. ""We're so happy all this is happening,"" said Julie DePasquale, a clerk at German Bread Haus two doors from the    Oakland Park clinic. She said it is popularwith out-of-state pill seekers. ""I'll feel safer coming to work at 7    o'clock in the morning. The druggies are out there like the night of the living dead, waiting for that place to    open. It's scary."" The raids were led by agents from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the Broward Sheriffs Office, the    Palm Beach County Sheriffs Office and police departments from the state and cities. Florida Department of    Health inspectors were on hand to initiate disciplinary actions against clinic doctors and owners.

Not if you're not licensed   18   appropriately.   19        Q.   Not licensed. And what Congress has   20   done is it created licensed manufacturers,   21   correct?   22              MS.

Is that Cardinal's understanding?   7        A.   Correct.   8        Q.   Prior to the enactment or the rendering   9   of this Masters Pharmaceutical opinion, when you   10   mentioned there was a shipping requirement   11   Cardinal believes it had, how far back did that   12   same shipping requirement go?   13        A.   Back to approximately 2007.   14        Q.   We're going to baby step this, okay? So   15   bear with me.   16        A.   Okay.   17        Q.   So from approximately some point in   18   2007, Cardinal believes it had the shipping   19  requirement that's set out in the Masters 2 o Pharmaceutical case applicable to them?   21        A.   Approximately, because obviously I think   22   we'll get there. The Dear Registrant letters   23   started coming out. So approximately that time   24  period.    Page 127   1        Q.   Prior to 2000� prior to the rendering   2   of the Masters Pharmaceutical case, did Cardinal   3   have a shipping requirement?   4        A.   Yes.   5        Q.   How far back does Cardinal take the   6  position that this shipping � strike that.   7             Prior to 2017 and the rendering of this   8   Masters Pharmaceutical opinion, does Cardinal   9   believe its shipping requirement was the same as   10   outlined here in the Masters Pharmaceutical case?   11        A.   Generally, yes.   12        Q.   Okay. So as it relates to � and we're   13   not going to talk necessarily about how far back   14   it goes yet.   15             So we have an understanding, the   16   shipping requirement gives you two choices,   17   correct?   18        A.   As it's laid out here, yes.   19        Q.   And you agree � Cardinal agrees with 2 o that, correct?   24       A.   Yes.   22        Q.   Okay. The first choice is you can   23   decline the ship? You can cut the order as   24   Cardinal uses the phrase, correct?   Page 129   1        Q.   So since 2007 or approximately that time   2   period, Cardinal has not shipped suspicious   3   orders, correct?   4        A.   Since 2007, Cardinal Health has not   5   shipped an order that it has reported as   6   suspicious to the DEA.   7        Q.   And since 2007, Cardinal has not shipped   8   a suspicious order that it hasn't determined �   9   that it hasn't done the due diligence on to   10 determine it's not going to be diverted, correct? 44            MS. MAINIGI: Objection; form.   12        A.   Since approximately 2007, Cardinal   13   Health has not shipped an order it has reported as   14   suspicious to the DEA.   15        Q.   Okay. So how many orders since 2007 �   16  how many suspicious orders has Cardinal shipped   17   that it failed to report to the DEA �   7 8            MS. MAINIGI: Objection; form. 7 9       Q.   -since 2007?   20        A.   None to Cardinal Health's knowledge.   21        Q.   Prior to 2007, was Cardinal shipping   22   suspicious orders?   23        A.   Prior to its understanding from the DEA   24   of the obligation, the change, the sea change in    Golkow Litigation Services    Page: 33 (126 - 129)     Case\&%^-&�Qfc$�RtQg$ #1 1�&J^CE'I<&> W^%tt&&\-d%m}8ft-\&S&&    lew    Page 130      Page 132    1 the obligation to suddenly � suddenly maybe is   l   comply with that required the reporting of    2  the wrong word � to not �   2   suspicious orders, correct?    3       Q.   I mean, suddenly is good for you.   3   A.   Cardinal understood the language of the    4       A.   � to not ship pursuant to the guidance   4   statute �    5 by the DEA, it was a report only period. Cardinal   5   Q.   Hold on. Hold on. I'm not �    6 Health made the reports as required by the DEA.   6   MS. MAINIGI: Let her finish. Let her    7       Q.   So prior to 2007, Cardinal was shipping   7   finish.    8  suspicious orders? Well, strike that. Let me   8   MR. FULLER: Okay.    9 back up.   9   BY MR. FULLER:    10            Prior to this approximate time frame of   10   Q.   Sorry. Go ahead.    11 2007, which we have yet to nail down, Cardinal was   11   A.   Cardinal Health understood the language    12  shipping orders that it reported as suspicious?   12   of the statute and the guidance we received from    13       A.   During the time period prior to 2007,   13   the DEA and was making the reports accordingly.    14 Cardinal Health's obligation was to report only.   14   Q.   So my question is, did Cardinal file    15       Q.   Yes, ma'am. I got that. But my   15   suspicious order reports prior to approximately    16 question is, prior to this approximate 2007 time   16   2007?    17 frame, Cardinal was shipping suspicious orders   17   MS. MAINIGI: Objection; form.    18  after it reported � well, strike that. Let me   18   A.   I don't know that that's what they were    19  ask it differently.   19   calling them at that time. Again, we filed per    20            Prior to 2007, do you know whether   20   the DEA's guidance ingredient limit reports,    2 7 Cardinal was reporting and then shipping   21   excessive order reports.    22  suspicious orders or shipping suspicious orders   22   Q.   So prior to 2007 � so prior to 2007,    23  and then reporting?   23   Cardinal was knowingly shipping orders that it    24            MS. MAINIGI: Objection; form.   24   knew qualified as suspicious under the regulation,    Page 131      Page 133    1 Objection; time period.   1   correct?    2            Go ahead.   2   MS. MAINIGI: Objection; form.    3       A.   In accordance from the guidance we   3   Objection; time period.    4 received from the DEA, Cardinal Health was making   4   A.   No, not necessarily.    5 the reports as required by the DEA, the ingredient   5   Q.   What you've told us � and see if I    6 limit reports and the excessive order reports, and   6   understand it correctly.    7 it was shipping orders in accordance with the   7   You told us that prior to 2007, Cardinal    8 guidelines from the DEA. If pursuant to one of   8   only had a reporting requirement according to    9 those excessive order reports the DEA said ""Do not   9   Cardinal, correct?    10  ship,"" we did not ship.   10   A.   According to Cardinal and others, yes.    11       Q.   You mentioned excessive order reports   11   Q.   And, therefore, Cardinal believes it was    12  and some other type of reports.   12   doing what it was supposed to do in reporting    13       A.   Ingredient limit reports.   13   suspicious orders, but it was still shipping    14       Q.   Was Cardinal actually reporting   14   suspicious orders, correct?    15  suspicious orders prior to this time period in   15   A.   Cardinal Health was doing what it was    76 2007?   16   directed to do by the DEA.    77            MS. MAINIGI: Objection; time period.   17   Q.   So I'm just asking, during this time    7 8            Go ahead.   18   frame prior to 2007, did Cardinal report orders as    19       A.   As required by the DEA, we were   19   potentially suspicious or suspicious orders and    2 o  submitting the ingredient limit reports pursuant   20   then still send the shipments out?    2 7 to the guidance we received, as well as the   21   MS. MAINIGI: Objection; time period.    22  excessive order reports.   22   A.   Yes. That is the direction we received    23       Q.   But during this time prior to 2007,   23   from the DEA. We made the reports as required,    24 Cardinal knew that it had a rale that it had to   24   and there was not a shipping requirement.

Now, just so I understand, what is an �   1   BY MR. FULLER:    2  you said ""an excessive order report."" What is   2   Q.   Would you agree with that?    3  that?   3   A.   I would agree with that.    4       A.   Within the distribution centers, the   4   Q.   Okay. Now, conversely, when we say    5 folks that are picking the orders have the ability   5   ""reporting requirement,"" we don't mean not report?    6 to identify an order of a new rule, size, pattern,   6   A.   Correct.    7 or frequency, and raise their hand, so to speak,   7   Q.   Okay.    8 to identify that order, and in doing so, during   8   A.   We can blame Masters.    9 this time period, we were submitting those to the   9   Q.   Tell me what Cardinal's position �    10 DEA as excessive order reports.   10   strike that.    11       Q.   Would they be submitted order by order,   11   So it's Cardinal's position that the    12  or was it a compilation of things that occurred   12   first time they were informed of a potential    13  over a period of time?   13   shipping requirement was in Rannazzisi's 2006    14       A.   My understanding is order by order.   14   letter that was sent to all the distributors in    15       Q.   And what's an ingredient limit report?   15   the industry?    16       A.   An ingredient limit report is the report   16   A.   Yes.    17 that was required pursuant to the 1998 DEA report   17   Q.   Cardinal also had meetings with the DEA    18 to, I believe, the Attorney General. It included   18   around this time frame as well, correct?    19 the algorithm for certain pharmaceuticals, and we   19   A.   Yes.    20 on a monthly basis provided the report of the   20   Q.   When is the first meeting that Cardinal    2 7 customers who had exceeded the designated amount   21   had with the DEA?    22  that you achieve pursuant to doing the algorithm,   22   MS.

Any time prior to this that you're aware    Page 135      Page 137    1 correct?   1   of.    2       A.   I believe so. I'm not � I'm actually   2   A.   Prior to the receipt of the first    3  not positive.   3   Rannazzisi letter?    4       Q.   So does Cardinal believe � well, let's   4   Q.   Yes, ma'am.    5 try to nail down this time frame in 2007 first,   5   A.   I know we had a meeting with the DEA    6 okay?   6   regarding Internet pharmacies in 2005, but not    7       A.   Okay.   7   with � not the subject of what ultimately came    8       Q.   What is its � what is Cardinal's   8   out in the Rannazzisi letter.    9 position as to � strike that.   9   Q.   Well, then let's backstep that. There    10            Is it Cardinal's position or   10   was actually a meeting with Cardinal and the DEA    11 understanding that the initial Rannazzisi letter   11   in approximately August of 2005; is that correct?    12  in 2006 informed them of a shipping requirement as   12   A.   I believe that's the time frame, yes.    13  we've described it?   13   Q.   And this meeting included concerns    14       A.   Yes. That was the first communication   14   related to the Controlled Substances Act and the    15 Cardinal received regarding this sea change of   15   distribution of controlled substances, correct?    16  adding a shipping requirement to the obligations.   16   MS.

I know the meeting � the topic of the    18 clarification, because when you see the phrase   18   meeting was Internet pharmacies.

Was there any further communication   11   A.   Yes. It appears to be the document I've    12 between Cardinal Health and the DEA between   12   reviewed.    13  September of '06 and December of '07 when the   13   Q.

Part of the design is to ensure that   16   reasonable steps to ensure that their registration    17 there are effective controls against diversion.   17   is not being utilized as a source of diversion?    18       Q.   To prevent diversion, right?   18   A.   Cardinal Health has an obligation to    19       A.   To maintain �   19   comply with the statute, the regulations, the law    28            MS.

And does that mean they have to take    23       A.   To maintain effective controls against   23   steps to prevent their registration from being    24 diversion, yes.   24   used as a source of diversion; yes or no?

That is guidance provided by the DEA.   2        Q.   So being that this letter is guidance   3   provided by the DEA, then the answer is yes,   4   Cardinal has to take steps to prevent its   5   registration from being used as a source of   6   diversion, correct?   7        A.   Generally, yes.   8        Q.   Generally, yes, or yes?   9        A.   Generally, yes, in accordance with the   10   statute, the regulations, and the guidance   11   provided by the DEA.   12        Q.   Well, you've told me that several times.   13   And then I asked the follow-up, being that this   14   letter is guidance from the DEA, you would agree   15   with that, correct?   16        A.   Um-hmm, yes.   17        Q.   Cardinal agrees that this September 27,   18   2006 letter provided by Rannazzisi, who was at the   19   DEA, is providing guidance to the wholesale 2 o distributor industry, correct?   21        A.   Correct.   22        Q.   Okay. And as part of that guidance,   23   he's telling wholesale distributors, including   24   Cardinal, that they need to take steps to prevent   Page 152   1   vigilant in deciding whether a prospective   2   customer can be trusted to deliver controlled   3   substances only for lawful purposes; correct?   4              MS. MAINIGI: Objection; form.   5        A.   In maintaining effective controls   6   against diversion, yes.   7        Q.   So if Cardinal has a basis or a reason   8   for knowing a customer of theirs, a drugstore or   9   pharmacy, may be obtaining controlled substances   10   for an unlawful purpose, Cardinal has an   11   obligation not to participate in that scheme,   12   correct?   43            MS. MAINIGI: Objection; form.   14        A.   If Cardinal Health is aware that a   15   customer is doing that, Cardinal Health would not   16   sell to that customer.   17        Q.   Now, let me ask you, as it relates to   18   Cardinal's obligation, does Cardinal actually have   19   to be aware of actual diversion by the drugstore   2 o or pharmacy or the potential for diversion by that   21   drugstore or pharmacy?   22              MS. MAINIGI: Objection; scope.   23        A.   What obligation are you referring to?   24        Q.   The obligation where it's going to sell    Page 151   1   the registration from being used as a source of   2   diversion; yes or no?   3        A.   Yes, that is the guidance provided in   4   this letter.   5        Q.   Fair enough. Thank you. Read the rest   6   of that paragraph for me, please.   7        A.   ""Distributors are, of course, one of the   8   key components in the distribution chain. If the   9   closed system is to function properly, as Congress   10   envisioned, distributors must be vigilant in   11   deciding whether a prospective customer can be   12   trusted to deliver controlled substances only for   13   lawful purposes.""   14              ""This responsibility is critical as   15   Congress has expressly declared that the illegal   16   distribution of controlled substances has a   17   substantial and detrimental effect on the health   18   and general welfare of the American people.""   19        Q.   And Cardinal agrees and accepts that   2 o distributors are one of the key components in the   21   distribution chain; is that right?   22              MS. MAINIGI: Objection; form.   23        A.   Yes.   24        Q.   And that the distributors must be   Page 153   1   those drugs to that pharmacy.   2              MS. MAINIGI: Objection; form and scope.   3        A.   Under the statute, Cardinal has an   4   obligation to identify and report suspicious   5   orders, and then under the additional guidance   6   provided by the DEA, the further obligation to not   7   ship those orders that it has reported as   8   suspicious.   9        Q.   And as we talked earlier, Cardinal has   10   an affirmative obligation to maintain effective   11   controls against diversion, correct?   12        A.   Correct.   13        Q.   That's separate from the suspicious   14   order regulation; isn't that true?   15        A.   Correct.   16        Q.   So in order to �   17        A.   Not completely separate, but yes.   18        Q.   It's in the Controlled Substances Act, I   19   will give you that. 28       A.   Yes.   21        Q.   And the Controlled Substances Act   22   spawned the regulation created by the DEA for   23   suspicious orders, fair enough?   24        A.   Yes.

So the requirement to maintain   i   A.   If they pose an unreasonable risk of    2 effective controls against diversion means we have   2   diversion or we know they are diverting, Cardinal    3 to try to prevent diversion; is that correct?   3   Health will not sell to them.    4            MS.

Is it a reasonable belief or   18   -----    19 we know they're diverting?

Ms. Norris, have you ever seen this    3 pharmacy or a drugstore, it has the affirmative   3   document before?    4 obligation to not sell opioids to that drugstore,   4   A.

The Knowing Your Customer is a component    18 see ""Key Takeaways""?   18   of our anti-diversion program.    7 9       A.   Yes.   19   Q.   And as you testified to earlier, even    20       Q.   And, there again, in this summary from   20   prior to that program going into place, you still    2 7 HDMA being provided to its members is again the   21   would take steps to know the customer; is that    22 DEA's position on suspicious orders and that they   22   fair?    23 have a stop shipment or a due diligence   23   A.   We've always had the anti-diversion    24 requirement, correct? I'm sorry. It's under the   24   program, the suspicious order monitoring program.

And I'm still taken aback.   4              Based on when Cardinal became informed   5   of this shipping requirement by the DEA, sitting   6   here today, you can't tell us when they took any   7   action in that regard, correct? Actually, let's   8   backstep it.   9              The policies and procedures that were   10   entered into in the latter part of '08 � we   11   looked at some of them earlier, right, December of   12   '08?   13        A.   Mm-hmm.   14        Q.   Do you remember that? 75       A.   Yes.   16        Q.   Okay. Some of those, I believe � and   17   correct me if I'm wrong � include a shipping   18   requirement; do they not?   19        A.   The policy that we looked at mentions 2 o held orders.   21        Q.   So we know at least two years after   22   Cardinal was aware of the shipping requirement,   23   they did something, right?   24              MS. MAINIGI: Objection; form.   Page 300   1        A.   I don't recall specifically.   2        Q.   So sitting here today, you don't know if   3   there was a shipping requirement in 2007, correct?   4             MS. MAINIGI: Objection to form.   5   Misstates her testimony.   6        A.   My understanding is our suspicious order   7   monitoring system, including the shipping   8   requirement, was implemented in late 2007.   9        Q.   Well, just a minute ago you couldn't   10   tell me when y'all first did something in relation   11   to the new shipping requirement.   12             Wasn't that your testimony?   43            MS. MAINIGI: Objection to form.   14   Misstates her testimony.   15        A.   I don't believe so. I believe we were   16   talking about the period between 2006 and 2000�   17   the receipt of the first letter and when we did   18   implement. We never established when we   19   implemented.   20        Q.   So you believe that you implemented a   2 7 policy and procedure for the shipping requirement   22   in late 2007?   23             MS. MAINIGI: Objection to form.   24        A.   We initiated our suspicious order    Page 299   1        Q.   September of '06 to December of '08. I   2   was giving you the benefit of the doubt. It's   3   actually 26 months, a little over two years,   4   correct?   5        A.   We have a policy dated 2008 that   6   mentions held orders. It does not � it does not   7   make a statement about prior time period.   8        Q.   And sitting here today, can you tell the   9  jury if Cardinal did anything prior to that policy   10   related to what Cardinal considers new obligation   11   as far as shipping requirement?   12              MS. MAINIGI: Objection to form.   13        A.   Yes. Our anti-diversion program was   14   implemented � anti-diversion system, suspicious   15   order monitoring system, was implemented in late 76 2007.   17        Q.   And did it include a shipping   18   requirement? 7 9       A.   Yes.   20       Q.   And where is the policy that   2 7 specifically provides the shipping requirement?   22        A.   I don't have a copy of that particular   23   policy.   24        Q.   Did you review it?   Page 301   1   monitoring system in late 2007. I cannot speak to   2   policies and procedures.   3        Q.   Okay. Fair enough. Who is Dendright?   4        A.   Dendright?   5        Q.   Yes, ma'am.   6        A.   My understanding is that Dendright is a   7   third party we engaged to perform, I believe, site   8   visits.   9                                     ____   10         (Cardinal-Norris Exhibit 33 marked.)   n                        ___   12              MR.

I can't remember if it's Dendright.   7   Ms. Norris is just going to clarify so that it's    8       Q.   But at least apparently in 2008, it was   8   clear.    9 Dendright?   9   BY MR.

So I'll ask the question again.   17   Did Cardinal have in place a system for reporting   18   all suspicious orders prior to 2007? 7 9       A.   Yes.   20                                     ____   2 7         (Cardinal-Norris Exhibit 34 marked.)   22                                     ____   23        Q.   Now, as Norris 19, I'm going to pass you   24   what has been marked as Plaintiffs 34. And I'm   Page 308   1   this topic, you mentioned two reports when you   2   talked about the prior to '07 suspicious order   3   reporting, the ingredient �   4        A.   The ingredient limit report.   5         Q.   And then another one.   6        A.   Excessive order reports.   7         Q.   Where would I find those reports?   8        A.   My understanding is that some of them   9   have been produced.   10         Q.   And where does Cardinal keep those   11   reports?   12              MS. MAINIGI: Objection; outside the   13   scope.   14         Q.   Are they electronic reports? I think   15   you testified earlier they were.   16              MS. MAINIGI: Objection to form.   17        A.   No, I didn't testify that those were   18   electronic. I � the reports I have seen appear   19   to be facsimiles, faxes, that were sent back and   20   forth. So I guess maybe that's electronic.   21         Q.   Are they handwritten?   22         A.   It's a form that's filled out with   23   handwriting on it, yes.   24              MS. MAINIGI: I believe Ms. Norris    Page 307   1   willing to bet you've looked at this before today.   2        A.   Yes.   3        Q.   Does that appear to be a true and   4   accurate copy of the Memorandum of Agreement   5   between the United States Department of Justice,   6   the DEA, and Cardinal Health?   7        A.   Yes. It's not the fully executed copy,   8   but...   9        Q.   And if you turn to page 2 of that 10 document.   44       A.   Yes.   12        Q.   Do you see there in the first paragraph,   13   ""Cardinal admits that its due diligence efforts   14   for some pharmacy customers and its compliance   15   with the 2008 MOA in certain respects were   16   inadequate."" 47            Correct?   18        A.   I see that language, yes.   19        Q.   Does Cardinal agree with that?   20        A.   ""Cardinal agrees that its due diligence   2 7 efforts for some pharmacy customers in certain   22   respects were inadequate and thus its compliance   23   with the 2008 MOA.""   24        Q.   Oh, and then we � before we finish with   Page 309   1   referred you to Exhibit 20, which is a policy that   2   contains reference to them.   3              MR. FULLER: Thank you.   4   BY MR. FULLER:   5        Q.   Okay. So I believe � and I may be   6   wrong, but I believe earlier you testified that   7   those were electronic reports.   8              Are you now saying they are not   9   electronic reports?   48            MS. MAINIGI: Objection to form.   11        A.   The ingredient limit report is prepared   12   electronically. The excessive order reports are   13   filled out when one comes up and sent to the DEA.   14        Q.   So that's a system that's done manually,   15   correct?   16        A.   Yes. These are the orders that are   17   identified in the distribution center as the folks   18   are picking them.   19        Q.   And based on the � now I'm switching   20   back gears to Exhibit 34. 24       A.   Okay.   22        Q.   All right. So based on this Memorandum   23   of Understanding entered in 2012, there were fines   24   of combined, I guess, $44 million paid by Cardinal    Golkow Litigation Services    Page: 78 (306 - 309)     Case:^^-�3g^g^te�>$ #� lSS^cE''^ ^2^8r8Q:8r#l-dl^^M:t^6g84    iew    Page 310      Page 312    1 for its breaches of the Controlled Substances Act,   l   actually adopting that as a policy, procedure, or    2 correct?   2   in any other form or format, correct?    3       A.

PagelD #: 127937    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    I.         Introduction    A.        Qualifications    1.   I graduated from St. Johns University, College of Pharmacy, and received a Bachelor of Science degree in Pharmacy in 1963.    2.   Upon graduating from St. John's University, College of Pharmacy, with a Bachelor of Science degree, I practiced as a licensed pharmacist from 1963 to 1966. I was a licensed pharmacist in the states of Virginia and New York. I later retired my pharmacist licenses as I was not practicing.    3.   In 1966,1 began working for the New York State Department of Health, Bureau of Narcotic Control, inspecting nursing homes, pharmacies, and hospitals, and investigating forged prescriptions.    4.   I entered federal service in 1969 with the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (""BNDD""), the predecessor agency to the Drug Enforcement Administration (""DEA""), where I was assigned from 1969 to 1973 as a Special Agent in the New York Regional Office. I conducted criminal and regulatory investigations of dosage form and bulk manufacturers, distributors, hospitals, researchers, analytical laboratories, importers, exporters and pharmacies.    5.   I attended the BNDD Training School in 1969. This consisted of a multi-month intensive training program which covered topics related to controlled substances including investigative techniques, undercover work, firearms training, and rules and regulations. While stationed in New York with the BNDD, I also attended the University of Rhode Island College of Pharmacy for one month to take a summer course on pharmaceutical manufacturing of controlled substances.    6.   In 1972,1 was promoted to Group Supervisor at DEA. As a Group Supervisor, I supervised both Special Agents and Diversion Investigators.    7.   In 1973, I was transferred to DEA headquarters in Washington DC where I was assigned to head the newly formed Diversion Prevention Program, staffed by a specialized work force of Diversion Investigators. At this time, I changed my position from a Special Agent to a Diversion Investigator. I was assigned to head and build out the Diversion Prevention Program. In this position I guided the implementation of domestic and worldwide programs associated with preventing the diversion of legally produced controlled substances and chemicals, formulated legislation and regulations to curtail potential diversion, evaluated controlled substances for scheduling under the CSA, and established security and recordkeeping systems and audit and investigative procedures. I also represented DEA in meetings and conferences with officials from international, federal, state and local agencies, the United Nations, the pharmaceutical and chemical industry, and the health care community.    8.    Starting in 1973,1 taught new-hire Diversion Investigators about the controlled substances regulations at DEA.     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1957-35  Filed:  07/23/19 6 of 43.  PagelD #: 127938    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    9.   During my 22-year tenure with DEA, I held various management positions prior to my appointment as Deputy Director of DEA's Office of Diversion Control in 1982, where I served until retirement from federal service in 1990.    10. In 1991, I established Buzzeo Associates, LTD which specialized in providing guidance regarding the implementing regulations of the Controlled Substance Act. I later formed PDMA, Inc. to provide consulting relating to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 (PDMA) which was signed into law by the President on April 22, 1988 and was enacted (1) to ensure that drug products purchased by consumers are safe and effective, and (2) to avoid the unacceptable risk to American consumers from counterfeit, adulterated, misbranded, sub potent, or expired drugs. The legislation was necessary to increase safeguards in the drug distribution system to prevent the introduction and retail sale of substandard, ineffective, or counterfeit drugs.    11. Buzzeo Associates, LTD and PDMA, Inc. merged into BuzzeoPDMA, Inc. BuzzeoPDMA specialized in both PDMA and CSA regulatory issues.    12. In 2005, BuzzeoPDMA was acquired by Dendrite; in 2007 Dendrite was acquired by Cegedim; and in 2015 Cegedim was acquired by IMS Health.    13.1 retired on August 1, 2016 from IMS Health after 50 years working as a pharmacist, state investigator, Special Agent, Diversion Investigator, President of a regulatory and outsource company and Chief Regulatory Officer of the BuzzeoPDMA business unit.    14.1 am currently an Independent Consultant.    15.1 have had numerous TV, radio and press interviews and extensive public speaking before law enforcement agencies, major pharmaceutical companies, professional associations, civic groups, and school children and their parents. I have had articles published in a number of professional publications, such as the NARC Officer, Drug Topics, U.S. Pharmacist, American Druggist, ASIS Security Management, other professional bulletins and co-authored the ""Pharmacist's Controlled Substances Regulatory Guide and Compliance Manual"" and the ""CSA Compliance and Counseling Kit"" for pharmacists.    16.1 also served as President and Treasurer of the International Narcotic Enforcement Officers Association (ENEOA) whose membership consisted of representatives from the law enforcement community, industry, and medical professions and represented the United States at a number of international and UN sponsored forums. I was a member of the National Advisory Committee to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation for Pain Management and State Regulatory Policy and also served as the Chairman of the American Society for Industrial Security (ASIS) Substance Abuse Committee for six years.    17. My CV is attached as Exhibit A    B.        Engagement for this Litigation    18. For my services as an expert witness, I am billing at a rate of $450.00 per hour plus reimbursement for expenses.  My compensation is not dependent on my testimony or on    -2-     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1957-35  Filed:  07/23/19 7 of 43.  PagelD #: 127939    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    the outcome of this case. All my opinions in this report are offered to a reasonable degree of professional certainty. I reserve the right to modify or supplement my opinions and this report should additional information become available.    II.        Assignment and Materials Considered    19.1 have been asked by counsel for Mallinckrodt LLC and SpecGx LLC (together ""Mallinckrodt"") to review the expert reports produced by the Track One Plaintiffs, in particular those related to the Controlled Substances Act, its implementing regulations, and the Defendants' suspicious order monitoring programs. In particular, I have focused on the reports of Seth Whitelaw, James Rafalski, Lacey Keller, and Craig McCann (together ""Plaintiffs' Experts""). I have reviewed these reports based on my years of industry experience focusing on the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations and have identified flaws in the assumptions, methodologies, and incomplete facts upon which these reports are based.    20.1 have also been asked by counsel for Mallinckrodt to review Mallinckrodt's suspicious order monitoring program and anti-diversion program consistent with my years of industry experience auditing manufacturers and distributors of controlled substances and evaluate to a reasonable degree of certainty the effectiveness of Mallinckrodt's programs based on the requirements of the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations; evolving DEA guidance; and evolving industry standards from 1998 to 2018 (the ""Review Period"").    21. In preparing this report, I reviewed the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations; DEA and industry guidance; Plaintiffs' Experts' reports; court filings; documents produced in this litigation; and certain depositions taken in this litigation. I have also relied on my more than fifty years of experience in the industry, including my 22 years working for DEA. A list of materials that I have considered is attached as Exhibit B    III.       Summary of Opinions    22. It is my opinion that during the Review Period Mallinckrodt maintained sufficient and effective controls against diversion of controlled substances.    23. It is my opinion that during the Review Period Mallinckrodt's suspicious order monitoring system was sufficient and effective to detect and report suspicious orders to DEA.    24. It is my opinion that throughout the Review Period DEA guidance and industry standards evolved over time and Mallinckrodt enhanced and upgraded its suspicious order monitoring and anti-diversion programs to meet changing DEA guidance and industry standards.    25. It is my opinion that there is no statutory or regulatory obligation for manufacturers to monitor downstream registrants that are not their customers.    -3-     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1957-35  Filed:  07/23/19 8 of 43.  PagelD #: 127940    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    26. It is my opinion that Mallinckrodt appropriately utilized the information and data available to it in its controlled substances compliance program and its suspicious order monitoring program.    27. It is my opinion that a suspicious order monitoring system that meets the regulations and expectations of DEA must be tailored to each individual registrant's business and the one-size-fits-all approach that Plaintiffs' counsel asked Dr. McCann and Ms. Keller to apply in their expert reports in this case is incorrect and does not identify suspicious orders placed to each of the Defendants.    IV.       Methodology    28. During my fifty years of experience in the industry, I have conducted dozens of audits of compliance systems, anti-diversion efforts, and suspicious order monitoring programs for DEA registrants. I have audited and evaluated suspicious order monitoring programs and anti-diversion programs of a number of controlled substances pharmaceutical manufacturers. I have assisted numerous registrants including controlled substances manufacturers in implementing suspicious order monitoring programs and anti-diversion programs.    29. In preparing this report, I evaluated Mallinckrodt's suspicious order monitoring program and anti-diversion efforts in the same way as I have in the dozens of audits and evaluations of controlled substances registrants in my fifty years of experience. Consistent with industry standards and past practices, I reviewed: standard operating procedures; transcripts of testimony of those individuals most intimately involved in the controlled substances program, the suspicious order monitoring system and anti-diversion efforts; internal communications and documentation of Mallinckrodt's processes and procedures, Mallinckrodt's communications with federal entities including DEA; the Controlled Substances Act and implementing regulations; DEA guidance; and testimony relating to DEA's interpretation and expectations regarding the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations.    V.        Regulatory Scheme and DEA Oversight A.        Supply Chain Overview    30. Under the Controlled Substances Act (""CSA""), DEA is responsible for control and oversight of the ""closed system of distribution"" of controlled substances. In the 'closed system of distribution,' all handlers of controlled substances must be registered with DEA.    31. Every person or entity that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports, or exports any controlled substance or who proposes to engage in the manufacture, distribution, dispensing, importation or exportation of any controlled substance must obtain a registration unless exempted.1 The key registrants in the controlled substances supply chain are importers, manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies, and physicians.    ^lC.F.R. � 1301.11(a).    -4-     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1957-35 Filed: 07/23/19 9 of 43.  PagelD #: 127941    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    32. An importer must possess a registration and permit to import into the custom territory of the United States from any place outside of the United States a Schedule I or II controlled substance or any narcotic controlled substance listed in Schedule III, IV, or V.2 The importer may distribute the controlled substance, for which the registration was issued, to another registrant.3    33. A manufacturer may distribute the controlled substance for which DEA has issued the registration and may conduct chemical analysis and preclinical research (including quality control analysis) with controlled substances listed in those schedules for which authorization as a manufacturer was issued by DEA.4 A manufacturer with a DEA registration may distribute any of the controlled substances it manufactures to any entity which possesses the required registration, including, a distributor, chain pharmacy distribution center, wholesaler, or hospital.5 Generally, manufacturers have little to no interaction with dispensers like hospitals and independent pharmacies that dispense a controlled substance, as they sell their product to distributors and wholesalers who then distribute the product to their own registrant customers.    34. A distributor purchases controlled substances from manufacturers and then sells the product to DEA registered dispensers like hospitals and independent pharmacies.6 Distributors may also sell to other registered distributors.7    35. A pharmacy, pursuant to its registration, may dispense a controlled substance pursuant to a prescription for a legitimate medical requirement; return controlled substances; and dispose of controlled substances.8    36.  To prescribe controlled substances, a physician must obtain a registration that lists the schedules for the controlled substances the physician intends to dispense or prescribe.9 In addition, a physician must ensure that the prescription is for a legitimate medical requirement.10 In my experience, when a physician prescribes a controlled substance, the physician will write either the brand name or the generic of the drug prescribed and if the branded product has a generic version, the dispensing pharmacist typically will substitute the generic product for the brand unless the physician has written that the dispenser is to prescribe as written. If a generic is dispensed, the pharmacist dispenses the generic product that the pharmacy happens to have on hand at that time, regardless of the manufacturer.    221C.F.R. � 1312.11(a).    3 21 C.F.R. � 1301.13(e)(l)(viii)    421C.F.R. � 1301.13(e)(l)(i).    5 21 C.F.R. � 1301.13(e)(l)(ii).    6 21 C.F.R. � 1301.13(e)(l)(ii).    7 21 C.F.R. � 1301.13(e).    8 21 C.F.R. � 1301.13(e)(l)(iv).    9 21 C.F.R. � 1306.03(a)(2).    10 21 C.F.R. � 1306.04(a).    -5-     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1957-35 Filed: 07/23/19 10 of 43.  PagelD #: 127942    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    37. Each level of the supply chain has different requirements for records, security, accountability, labeling, and anti-diversion efforts as outlined in the CSA and implementing regulations.    B.        DEA Oversight: Registration    38. DEA decides who may handle controlled substances. An entity must register with DEA before it may lawfully purchase, sell, and handle controlled substances.11 No person who is not registered may engage in any activity with controlled substances.12 When an entity's registration application is approved, DEA issues a Certificate of Registration.13 Certificates of Registration are not indefinite; they have an expiration date and registrants must renew their registration in order to continue handling controlled substances.14 Manufacturers must renew their registration annually.15    39.  There are several types of DEA registrations, depending on the entities' primary activities with respect to controlled substances. These registrations include: manufacturer, distributor, reverse distributor, researcher, analytical lab, importer, exporter, pharmacy, hospitals, physicians, and narcotic treatment program.16    40. In order to issue a new registration, DEA must determine that such registration is consistent with the public interest in accordance with the CSA.17 For manufacturers and distributors, DEA must determine on a yearly basis that the registration remains in the public interest.18    41. A registrant who engages in more than one activity must obtain a separate registration for each activity.19 A DEA registrant is also authorized to engage in certain coincident activities without obtaining a registration to engage in such coincident activities, unless specifically exempted, if he/she complies with all requirements and duties prescribed by law for those registered to engage in such coincident activities.20    42. In the case of an application for registration or reregi strati on to manufacture in bulk a basic class of controlled substance listed in Schedule I or II, DEA will, upon the filing of an application, publish in the Federal Register a notice naming the applicant and stating that the applicant has applied to be registered as a bulk manufacturer of a basic class of narcotic or nonnarcotic controlled substance.21 These requirements for publication do not apply to    11 21 C.F.R. � 1301.11(a).    12 21 C.F.R. � 1301.13(a).

DEA has the authority to audit registrants to ensure compliance with the CSA.23 DEA has many tools at its disposal to take action against any registrant that may not be in compliance with the CSA or implementing regulations, including letters of admonition, licensing hearings, orders to show cause, and immediate suspension orders.24 DEA can also seek civil or criminal penalties for violations of the CSA.25    C.        DEA Oversight: Quota    44. DEA decides how much of each Schedule I and II controlled substance each registrant can manufacture and/or sell. There are three types of quotas established annually by DEA to regulate the manufacture and distribution of Schedules I and II controlled substances.26    45.  The quota system was instituted under the Narcotic Manufacturing Act of 1960 in order for the United States to be in compliance with the international Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.27 The purpose of quotas was to limit exclusively to medical and scientific purposes the manufacture of narcotic drugs.28 With the passage of the CSA in 1970, the system was revised to establish quotas on a calendar year basis for all Schedule I and II controlled substances.29 Quota is one of the tools used by DEA (along with registration, records, security provisions, reporting requirements, scheduling, and import and export controls) to establish a closed system for the legitimate distribution chain.    46. Aggregate production quota places a national limit on the amount of each controlled substance in Schedules I and II which may be produced in a given year.30 DEA, with the advice of the Food and Drug Administration, establishes production quotas for each basic class of controlled substances in Schedules I and II to be manufactured each calendar year to provide for the estimated medical, scientific, research and industrial needs of the United States, for lawful export requirements, and for the establishment and maintenance of reserve stocks.31    47. Manufacturing quota is the amount of a controlled substance a company can produce in a given calendar year.32 DEA issues individual manufacturing quotas to registered bulk manufacturers.33 Manufacturing quotas are determined on the basis of each manufacturer's    22 21 C.F.R. � 1301.33(c).    23 21 C.F.R. � 1301.31.    24 21 C.F.R. � 1301.36(a)-(e).    25 21 U.S.C. � 843(d); 21 C.F.R. � 1316.31.    26 21 U.S.C. � 826(a)(1).    27 Pub.

Procurement quota is issued to registered manufacturers who purchase the bulk controlled substance and formulate the substance into finished dosage forms.37 Procurement quotas are issued annually by the ""share-of-the-market theory"" to the various procurement quota applicants.38 Share-of-the market is determined by calculating the percentage of business a firm did in a particular basic class the previous year as compared to the total sales of all the firms utilizing that same basic class.39    49. DEA is required to set the aggregate production quota consistent with the estimated medical, scientific, research, and industrial needs of the United States.40 In determining the amount of aggregate production needed by the United States, DEA considers such factors as: estimates from IMS Health on retail consumption based on prescriptions dispensed; data from DEA's internal ARCOS tracking system; past histories of quota granted; estimates of the projected medical, scientific, and reserve stock needs provided by FDA's controlled substances staff; manufacturers' production history and anticipated needs; data on diversion of controlled substances, such as information from case seizures and national databases of drug evidence; and any other information that DEA deems relevant.41 As Stacy Harper-Avilla, DEA's designated witness on this topic made clear, each of these factors was considered during the Review Period.42 Based on these considerations, DEA sets the total amount of material for each controlled substance that may be manufactured in a given year.43 This amount is adjusted by inventory requirements of the bulk manufacturers and apportioned among them, through manufacturing quotas based upon their respective historical share of the market.44 The sum of these manufacturing quotas does not and cannot exceed the aggregate production quota.45    50. A manufacturer may not manufacture and distribute beyond the manufacturing or procurement quota provided to it by DEA in a calendar year.46 If market conditions change    21 C.F.R. � 1303.22.    34  -    35 21 C.F.R. � 1303.22.    36 21 C.F.R. � 1303.26.    37 21 C.F.R. � 1303.12(b).    38 21 C.F.R. � 1303.12(c).    39 21 C.F.R. � 1303.11.    40 21 C.F.R. � 1303.11(a).    41US-DEA-00015423 at 9-10.    42 Harper-AvillaDep.

D.        DEA Oversight: ARCOS    51. DEA can see the details of every transaction of Schedule I and II controlled substances as well as narcotic controlled substances in Schedule III in DEA's Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System (ARCOS) database.47 To feed the ARCOS database, DEA requires registrants to report transactions of those controlled substances.48    52. Acquisition/distribution transaction reports must be filed by registrants at least every quarter, or more frequently depending on the number of transactions reported by the registrant.49 In addition to reporting acquisition/distribution transactions, each registrant who is registered to manufacture controlled substances in bulk or dosage form must report manufacturing transactions on controlled substances in Schedules I and II, and each narcotic controlled substance listed in Schedule III.50    53. All ARCOS reports must be filed with DEA.51 The registrant must provide the data in a manner as to identify the particular form, strength, and trade name, if any, of the product containing the controlled substance for which the report is being made.52 Registrants filing reports must utilize the National Drug Code Number assigned to the product under the National Drug Code System of the Food and Drug Administration.53    54.  Thus, all transactions of the Schedule II opioids at issue in this matter are reported to DEA and reflected in the ARCOS database. Through the reporting by manufacturers and distributors of Schedule II opioid products, among other products, DEA has full visibility of opioids through the distribution chain to the pharmacy level on a nationwide basis. This allows DEA to determine orders and purchases that may warrant DEA review.    VI.      Anti-Diversion Regulations    55.  The supply chain for controlled substances is regulated by DEA based on the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations.54 The anti-diversion language of the CSA has not changed since 1971, nor has the suspicious order monitoring regulation.55    47 Wright Dep.

The CSA requires that manufacturers must maintain ""effective controls against diversion of particular controlled substances into other than legitimate medical, scientific, and industrial channels"" in order to obtain and keep a license to manufacturer controlled substances.56 It further requires that:    All applicants and registrants shall provide effective controls and procedures to guard against theft and diversion of controlled substances. In order to determine whether a registrant has provided effective controls against diversion, the Administrator shall use the security requirements set forth in Sees. 1301.72-1301.76 as standards for the physical security controls and operating procedures necessary to prevent diversion.57    In evaluating the overall security system of a registrant or applicant, the Administrator may consider any of the following factors as he may deem relevant to the need for strict compliance with security requirements: (1) The type of activity conducted (e.g., processing of bulk chemicals, preparing dosage forms, packaging, labeling, cooperative buying, etc.); (2) The type and form of controlled substances handled (e.g., bulk liquids or dosage units, usable powders or non-usable powders); (3) The quantity of controlled substances handled; (4) The location of the premises and the relationship such location bears on security needs; (5) The type of building construction comprising the facility and the general characteristics of the building or buildings; (6) The type of vault, safe, and secure enclosures or other storage system (e.g., automatic storage and retrieval system) used; (7) The type of closures on vaults, safes, and secure enclosures; (8) The adequacy of key control systems and/or combination lock control systems; (9) The adequacy of electric detection and alarm systems, if any including use of supervised transmittal lines and standby power sources; (10) The extent of unsupervised public access to the facility, including the presence and characteristics of perimeter fencing, if any; (11) The adequacy of supervision over employees having access to manufacturing and storage areas; (12) The procedures for handling business guests, visitors, maintenance personnel, and nonemployee service personnel; (13) The availability of local police protection or of the registrant's or applicant's security personnel; (14) The adequacy of the registrant's or applicant's system for monitoring the receipt, manufacture, distribution, and disposition of controlled substances in its operations; and (15) The applicability of the security requirements contained in all Federal, State, and local laws and regulations governing the management of waste.58    57. Based on my experience with DEA, I understand that the CSA requires registrants to maintain effective controls against diversion while the product is under their control. Each registrant is responsible for the product until it is received by another registrant. This focus    21 U.S.C. � 823(a)(1). 21 C.F.R. � 1301.71(a). 21 C.F.R. � 1301.71(b).    -10-     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1957-35 Filed: 07/23/19 15 of 43.  PagelD #: 127947    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    of the statutory language is made clear by the security requirements laid out in 21 CFR 1301.71-1301.93. The expectation of the CSA is not that the registrant polices the entire supply chain, but rather that the registrant maintains effective controls against diversion and adequate security measures while it has control over the product.59    58.  The CSA does not define what ""effective controls"" means, does not contain examples of what constitutes ""effective controls"" and does not provide any further guidance about what manufacturers are required to do, but it is clear on its face that the focus is on preventing diversion while product remains in the registrant's control.    59. 21 CFR 1301.74(b) is no different. It focuses on what a registrant must do in relation to its orders from its own customers while the product is still under the registrant's control.    B.        Regulatory Duty: 21 C.F.R. Section 1301.74(b)    60. 21 CFR 1301.74(b) states: ""The registrant shall design and operate a system to disclose to the registrant suspicious orders of controlled substances. The registrant shall inform the Field Division Office of the Administration in his area of suspicious orders when discovered by the registrant. Suspicious orders include orders of unusual size, orders deviating substantially from a normal pattern, and orders of unusual frequency.""60    61. Neither the CSA nor any of the implementing regulations defines the term ""unusual size."" Neither the CSA nor any of the implementing regulations defines the term ""normal pattern."" Neither the CSA nor any of the implementing regulations defines the term ""unusual frequency."" I understand that several current and former DEA officials have testified in this case, and all agree that DEA has not defined any of these terms.61    62. Instead, DEA left it up to registrants to determine what those terms meant and to create and design their own suspicious order monitoring program accordingly. Based on my experience in DEA and in industry, I understand that DEA did not define these terms in part because it believed there was no one-size-fits-all approach to suspicious order monitoring.62 In fact, DEA 30(b)(6) witness Thomas Prevoznik admitted that there is ""no single feature that makes a suspicious order monitoring system compliant"" and agreed that    59 Rannazzisi Dep.

I said I don't expect you to police the supply chain, but I do expect you to police your own customers."").    60 21 C.F.R. � 1301.74(b). The regulation is clear on its face that registrants are only required to report orders that are actually suspicious.    61 See Prevoznik Dep. Tr. Vol. 1 at 273:7-20 (""With respect to orders that are placed to manufacturers, what constitutes an order of unusual size in the DEA's view? A.

For a time, DEA engaged in communications with manufacturers and distributors to discuss the suspicious order monitoring regulation and other DEA requirements. However, in my experience, DEA headquarters ceased most communications following the Rannazzisi DEA Letters of 2006 and 2007 and instead ramped up enforcement efforts.    64.  The suspicious order monitoring regulation has not changed since it was implemented.64 It is my understanding that in recent years DEA has been working on a change to the suspicious order monitoring regulation, which may further define the term ""suspicious order,"" but there has been no notice and comment and no new regulation.65    C.        There is no statutory or regulatory obligation for manufacturers to know their customers' customers    65. In my experience in DEA and as an industry consultant, I have never seen or heard DEA state that there is a statutory obligation in the CSA or a regulatory obligation in the suspicious order monitoring regulation for manufacturers to know their customers' customers. Demetra Ashley of DEA testified that she was not aware of any statute or regulation that requires a manufacturer to know its customers' customers.66    66. In my experience in DEA and as an industry consultant, I have never seen a DEA guidance letter or other DEA public statement or suggestion reflecting an obligation for a manufacturer to know its customers' customers.67 Based on my review of the testimony in this case, current and former DEA personnel have stated that there is no obligation for a manufacturer to monitor the activities of downstream registrants beyond its own customers. In his deposition, Joe Rannazzisi testified that he was not familiar with the phrase ""know    63    Id.    64 Rannazzisi Dep. Tr. Vol. 1 at 253:10-23; Prevoznik's Dep. Tr.

As discussed in detail below, this was not an industry expectation at the time; as an industry consultant we did not consider it to be industry standard or required by the regulation. Similarly, Mallinckrodt heard a one-off comment about ""know your customers' customers"" during an audit in 2010, but this did not reflect the position of DEA at the time and was contradicted by others in DEA contemporaneously.    -12-     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1957-35 Filed: 07/23/19 17 of 43.

Instead, the expectation and industry standard, consistent with the plain language of the CSA and the suspicious order monitoring regulation, was for manufacturers to monitor the orders they received from their customers (distributors, wholesalers, and distribution centers of retail pharmacy chains) and have a system in place to report suspicious orders that they received from their customers.    67. Further, the suspicious order monitoring regulation refers to ""orders.""70 Mallinckrodt receives orders from its customers, which are distributors, wholesalers, and distribution centers of retail pharmacy chains. An order is a transaction between a manufacturer and its customer and DEA has never indicated that ""order"" refers to anything other than a transaction between the registrant and their direct customer. Every registrant has a responsibility to monitor the orders received from the customer next to it in the supply chain.71 There is no regulatory requirement or expectation that manufacturers police the entire supply chain down to pharmacies, physicians, or patients.72    D. There is no statutory or regulatory obligation to collect, maintain, or utilize downstream transactional data, including chargeback data, for purposes of suspicious order monitoring    68.  Consistent with the plain language of the CSA and its implementing regulations, and in my experience in DEA and as an industry consultant, I have never seen or heard DEA state that there is a statutory or regulatory obligation for a registrant to collect, maintain, or utilize downstream transactional data, including chargeback data, for purposes of anti-diversion monitoring.

By way of example, when Mr. Wright was asked in his deposition what role chargebacks play in suspicious order monitoring, he responded ""none.""74 Similarly, DEA's 30(b)(6) witness Mr. Prevoznik testified that DEA has never issued guidance to manufacturers informing them that they should review chargeback data.75    70. In my experience in DEA and as an industry consultant, it is not industry standard for manufacturers to collect, maintain, or utilize downstream transactional data, including chargeback data, for suspicious order monitoring and anti-diversion purposes.    71. While I was aware of chargeback data during my time as an industry consultant, it was only discussed in the context of financial arrangements between registrants. Chargebacks are a financial reconciliation method between manufacturers and their customers that take place in connection with some but not all of the customers' downstream sales.76    72. In more recent years, since approximately 2012, although not required by the CSA or its implementing regulations, some registrants have explored the question of how they might use alternative data sources, like downstream transactional data, to address specific instances of potential downstream diversion that they become aware of. However, based on my experience, chargebacks were never used, discussed or thought of in the industry as something to be used for suspicious order monitoring. Because chargeback data is backward looking and does not reflect ""orders"" placed with the manufacturer registrant, this financial data was not considered a resource or tool for the purpose of suspicious order monitoring. As discussed throughout this report, in my years of industry experience I have never been aware of any obligation requiring manufacturers to monitor chargebacks and report them as if they were orders through their suspicious order monitoring programs.    73. In addition, I am aware that prescription data is used by manufacturers for commercial purposes and by DEA for making quota determinations of controlled substances.77 Prescription data is not order data and provides limited information about a manufacturers' product. In my experience in DEA and as an industry consultant, it was not industry    73 In fact, the first time I ever heard a claim of a requirement that manufacturers must utilize downstream transactional data was in reading Plaintiffs' expert reports in this case.

VII.     Mallinckrodt's Anti-Diversion Program Was Consistent with Anti-Diversion Regulations, Guidance, and Industry Standards During the Review Period    74. Mallinckrodt was founded in 1867 in St. Louis, Missouri to supply local pharmacists with materials and chemicals. When founded, Mallinckrodt was the only chemical supply company west of Philadelphia.78 Mallinckrodt began producing morphine and codeine in 1898. In the twentieth century, Mallinckrodt continued to advance the production of chemicals and pharmaceutical ingredients, improving the stability and safety of numerous medications. Mallinckrodt has manufactured controlled substances, in particular active pharmaceutical ingredients, since before DEA was formed in 1971.79 In that time, Mallinckrodt has worked in partnership with DEA to ensure that the legitimate needs of patients were met while taking steps to address the potential diversion of its products. In 2000, Mallinckrodt was acquired by Tyco International's healthcare division, which became Covidien in 2007. Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals later split from Covidien in 2013 to become an independent public company focusing on specialty pharmaceutical products and diagnostic imaging agents.80    75. While the CSA and suspicious order monitoring regulation have not changed since the 1970s, and DEA guidance has been limited, industry standards and compliance practices have evolved overtime. In my experience as an industry consultant, much of this evolution is related to advancements in technology. The tools, technology, and information available in 1995, or even in 2005, are very different from tools, technology, and information available today. In my opinion, based on my experience in DEA and as an industry consultant, Mallinckrodt's anti-diversion program was consistent with the Controlled Substances Act, DEA regulations, and industry standards at all times during the Review Period, 1998 through 2018. In addition, Mallinckrodt's chargeback review and monitoring system developed in 2010 and 2011 goes above and beyond both regulatory requirements and industry standards.    A.        1998-2007: Excessive Purchase Reporting    1.         1998-2007 Regulatory Landscape    76. Based on my extensive experience in DEA and in industry, from the passage of the CSA in 1971 to late 2006, DEA worked with the industry to make sure that registrants were implementing and following registration, records, quota, ARCOS, and security requirements in the CSA. DEA's priority during this time was to investigate in-transit losses and thefts and to investigate pharmacy registrants. Prior to 2006, it is my experience that DEA  focused  on  and  devoted  resources  to  practitioner  and  pharmacy-level    78 Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, Our Story, http://www.mallinckrodt.com/about/our-story/.    79 Id. mId.    -15-     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1957-35  Filed:  07/23/19 20 of 43.

During this time, DEA expectation was that a manufacturer would report to DEA excessive purchases by its customers. As Mr. Wright confirmed in his deposition testimony, the excessive purchase reporting system was the accepted practice by DEA for many years prior to 2008.81    2.         1998-2007 DEA Guidance    78. During this time, the only limited guidance for manufacturers regarding suspicious order monitoring was in an appendix to DEA's Chemical Handler's Manual, which recommended a voluntary computer algorithm to analyze orders submitted to a registrant to flag purchases that exceeded the algorithm.82    79. DEA did not provide any guidance other than the Chemical Handlers Manual until it began a distributor briefing initiative concerning internet pharmacies in 2005. As Mr. Prevoznik testified, DEA had determined by 2005 that with the rise of the internet, diversion was becoming more of a national issue.83 Therefore, DEA decided to sit down with distributors and provide them data about internet pharmacies. There was no such manufacturer initiative.84    80. In 2006, Joe Rannazzisi at DEA sent a letter to every commercial entity in the United States registered with DEA to distribute controlled substances with guidance on how to monitor    81    Wright Dep.

PagelD #: 127953    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    orders received from pharmacies.85 The letter focused on distributors' obligations with respect to their sales to pharmacy customers.86 It outlined ""red flags"" that distributors should look for when monitoring orders from pharmacies.87 This letter made no mention of obligations specific to a manufacturer and did not reference red flags that manufacturers should look for when monitoring orders received from distributors.    3.          1998-2007 Industry Standards    81. As a consultant during this time, 1998-2007,1 understood industry practice to be periodic reporting of excessive purchases to DEA. It is my experience in the industry that, 1998-2007, DEA headquarters and field offices expected and accepted from manufacturers excessive purchase reports, and approved excessive purchase report programs.88 Excessive purchase reports were documentation of orders that hit on a particular algorithm that were then provided to DEA on a monthly or quarterly basis based on instructions of the local DEA office that had authority over the registrant. While all purchases on the excessive purchase reports were not necessarily indicative of diversion, Mallinckrodt reported all excessive purchases and DEA accepted these reports.    82.  The goal of reporting excessive purchases was to provide DEA with information that the agency could use to determine whether to investigate certain registrants. The industry standard at the time was to provide this information to DEA and then it was DEA, not the manufacturer, who was responsible for undertaking any investigation of purchases reflected on excessive purchase reports. In my experience, the only other DEA expectation for manufacturers at this time was that they verify that each customer had a current DEA registration and that therefore DEA had determined that the customer had met the security requirements of the CSA.    83. During this time, 1998-2007, DEA also never suggested that manufacturers had any responsibilities with respect to knowing downstream registrants. DEA regulations do not require that a manufacturer review a pharmacy's registration before selling to a distributor and do not require that manufacturers examine individual patient prescriptions; there was no suggestion during this time that manufacturers should do so.    4.          1998-2007 Mallinckrodt Program    84. From 1998-2007, Mallinckrodt's anti-diversion program had several components that were consistent with DEA expectations and industry practice at the time. First, Mallinckrodt had an algorithm in place based on the algorithm guidance in the Chemical Handler's Manual that monitored and flagged orders.89 The algorithm measured each customer against its    85US-DEA-00001767    86 Id.    %1Id.    88    Wright Dep.

In addition to the algorithm that generated excessive purchase reports, Mallinckrodt took additional steps to monitor incoming orders. For example, Mallinckrodt's customer service representatives reviewed orders as they were received.92 Customer service representatives were familiar with customer and order patterns and would escalate anything that appeared to be of unusual size, frequency or pattern to the customer service manager and then to the Controlled Substances Compliance group.93 The customer service representatives were trained on what to look for in incoming orders and how to clear Form 222s.94 In addition, National Account Managers (NAMs) would meet with customers on a regular basis. NAMs were the ""eyes and ears"" of the suspicious order monitoring program and looked for red flags indicative of diversion.95 NAMs were trained by the Controlled Substances group to bring any questions or concerns to the compliance department's attention.

Mallinckrodt also reviewed all new customers to check that they had a valid license.97 As discussed above, DEA was required to determine that each registration was in the public interest and determine on a yearly basis that the registration remained in the public interest.98 Mallinckrodt also pulled Dun and Bradstreet credit reports as part of their diligence on new customers.99    87. Based on my review of documents and testimony in this case, I have been unable to locate explicit standard operating procedures regarding the anti-diversion and suspicious order monitoring systems that were in place at Mallinckrodt during the 1998-2007 time period. However, given the consistency of the deposition testimony of the key individuals involved with Mallinckrodt's anti-diversion program during this time, and my experience with typical document retention policies, I believe that the suspicious order monitoring and anti-diversion practices discussed above were followed by Mallinckrodt 1998-2007.10�    88. It is my opinion that 1998-2007, Mallinckrodt maintained sufficient and effective controls against diversion of controlled substances.    89. It is my opinion that 1998-2007, Mallinckrodt's suspicious order monitoring system was sufficient and effective to detect and report suspicious orders to DEA.101    90. It is my opinion that 1998-2007 Mallinckrodt appropriately utilized the information and data available to it in its controlled substances compliance program and its suspicious order monitoring program.    96    Harper Dep.

Vol. 1 at 358:21-59:1.    101  To the extent Mr. Rafalski criticizes Mallinckrodt for the number of suspicious orders reported, this shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the industry and the suspicious order monitoring regulation. Rafalski Rep. at 166. In my experience, registrants may have perfect suspicious order monitoring programs that do not report any orders because none of the orders is suspicious. In fact, it is not surprising that Mallinckrodt reported a relatively small number of suspicious orders given its customer base.    -19-     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1957-35  Filed:  07/23/19 24 of 43.

Although DEA wrote letters to the industry in 2006 and 2007, there was no change to the CSA's anti-diversion requirements or suspicious order monitoring regulation.102 Accordingly, consistent with prior years, neither the CSA nor the suspicious order monitoring regulation suggested that manufacturers needed to take any action to police the supply chain beyond the orders from their customers.    2.         2008-2009 DEA Guidance    92. In late 2007, all registrants received a letter from Joe Rannazzisi at DEA that reflected a significant change in DEA's guidance with respect to suspicious order monitoring.103 The 2007 DEA Letter explicitly stated that a registrant could no longer rely on past DEA statements regarding its suspicious order monitoring program.104 DEA stated that it would no longer accept excessive purchase reports that it had expected and accepted previously. The 2007 DEA Letter undermined everything the industry had understood at all times prior to 2008. DEA stated explicitly that it would refuse to provide guidance on suspicious order monitoring programs going forward.    93. First, the 2007 DEA Letter suggested that the previously-recommended algorithm from the Chemical Handlers Manual and industry was insufficient. The Agency warned that ""DEA does not approve or otherwise endorse any specific system for reporting suspicious orders. Past communications . . . that could be construed as approval of a particular system for reporting suspicious orders, should no longer be taken to mean that DEA approves a specific system.""105 In my experience, this was a significant change for the industry, required the industry to change how it implemented the suspicious order monitoring regulation, and was not based on any change to the CSA or suspicious order monitoring regulation but a new interpretation and attempts at enforcement of the same unchanged regulation.    94.  Second, the 2007 DEA Letter articulated brand new guidance from DEA that: ""[rjegistrants must conduct an independent analysis of suspicious orders prior to completing a sale.""106 Prior to this time, the Agency, through both headquarters and its field offices, had consistently accepted and signed off on programs in which registrants reported excessive    102 Rannazzisi Dep.

DEA has acknowledged that the 2007 DEA Letter was a major change for industry. Kyle Wright of DEA's Office of Diversion Control confirmed in sworn testimony in a 2011 Eastern District of Michigan case that the new investigate and halt-shipment requirements were a ""significant change"" to registrants' obligations.108 Mr. Wright also testified that, until the change in policy, ""DEA was aware that it was standard practice in the industry to file suspicious order reports while continuing to ship products, and that practice had been approved by the DEA.""1091 understand that Mr. Wright confirmed this belief in his more recent testimony in this case.110 Based on my experience in the industry, I agree with Mr. Wright's testimony that the 2007 DEA Letter signified a major change for the industry with little guidance on how to implement this major change in policy. Based on my experience, it is my opinion that DEA shifted responsibility for identifying potential investigative targets from the agency to industry without providing sufficient guidance to industry.111    96.   The 2007 DEA Letter does not mention the concept of knowing your customers' customers and does not suggest collecting or utilizing downstream transactional data for suspicious order monitoring.112 Based on my experience with DEA and industry consulting, there is nothing I reviewed in the letter that suggests that a manufacturer has an obligation to know their customers' customers or suggests that a manufacturer must collect or utilize downstream transactional data for suspicious order monitoring.    3.        2008-2009 Industry Standards    97.   During this time, manufacturers worked to implement the brand new DEA guidance in the 2007 DEA Letter. After sending the letter, DEA did not provide any further guidance to manufacturers.113 My understanding is that members of the industry, including Mallinckrodt, requested additional guidance and DEA did not respond.114 DEA also    107  Bench Trial Transcript at 382:24-383:18, United States v.

The 2007 DEA Letter did not provide guidance to manufacturers on what the order investigation process should look like. While the letter stated that registrants should investigate before shipping, there was no guidance about the point in time at which registrants must report. It was unclear whether registrants should report before the investigation {i.e., report potentially suspicious orders that were subsequently investigated by the registrant and, if cleared, were shipped) or report after the investigation {i.e., report only those orders that were confirmed suspicious after investigation and were not shipped).116 The 2007 DEA Letter also contained no detail about how to conduct due diligence on orders and the industry had no guidance about what type of diligence DEA expected.117    99.   Based on my experience, during the 2008-2009 time frame there was no discussion in industry that manufacturers must know their customers' customers because DEA had never mentioned an obligation or suggested that manufacturers know their customers' customers. Similarly, it was not industry practice for manufacturers to collect, maintain, or utilize any downstream transactional data for anti-diversion purposes because DEA had never mentioned the possibility of using downstream transactional data for these purposes. In my experience, the industry correctly viewed downstream transactional data as after-the-fact-data used for financial reconciliation.    4.        2008-2009 Mallinckrodt Program    100. After receipt of the December 2007 DEA Letter announcing the significant change in policy, Mallinckrodt took immediate steps to enhance its program consistent with DEA's changing guidance.118 Mallinckrodt promptly created a multidisciplinary Suspicious Order Monitoring Team (""SOM Team"") to work to update its suspicious order monitoring program.119 Mallinckrodt's SOM Team was led by members of the security, compliance, and legal departments, and also included customer service, operations, logistics, and    ma'am.. ..

In early 2008, Mallinckrodt received and complied with a request from the DEA St. Louis Field Office that it should stop sending excessive purchase reports.122 During the months when Mallinckrodt had ceased sending excessive purchase reports and was working to refine the suspicious order monitoring program and algorithm, Mallinckrodt maintained its prior suspicious order monitoring and anti-diversion efforts, including (1) monitoring incoming orders; (2) understanding existing customers; (3) reviewing new customers; and (4) flagging orders as potentially suspicious and reporting to DEA.123    102. Starting in 2008 and continuing into 2009, Mallinckrodt engaged in a multi-year effort to enhance and improve its suspicious order monitoring program. This effort is consistent with what I would expect from an organization trying to act on new and different agency guidance in a responsible way. In order to better understand the brand new guidance in the 2007 DEA Letter, Mallinckrodt reached out to industry consultants the Drug and Chemical Advisory Group and studied industry guidelines developed by HDMA.124 Both Mr. Rafalski and Dr. Whitelaw criticize Mallinckrodt for continuously updating its suspicious order monitoring standard operating procedures during this time period.125 This criticism is unfounded, as I would expect a company to revise and enhance its SOPs as it evolves its program based on changing regulatory guidance. Based on my experience in the industry, this is what I would expect to see from a company trying to enhance a compliance program based on limited regulatory guidance.    103. To enhance its program consistent with the new DEA guidance, Mallinckrodt first revised its suspicious order monitoring algorithm to generate a daily Peculiar Order Report of flagged orders that raised a question as to their size, frequency, or pattern.126 Mallinckrodt    120 Harper Dep.

PagelD #: 127960    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    reviewed and investigated the orders and determined whether they should be shipped or not shipped and reported to DEA.127    104. The customer service managers took a multi-step approach when conducting diligence on orders flagged on the Peculiar Order Reports. 128 First, they solicited information from Customer Service Representatives. They then reached out to Product Managers for more information about the particular product at issue in the order and the market for that product (for example, a product manager would be able to inform the customer service manager that a product was backordered). They also reached out to National Account Managers for additional information and to request further information from the customer. National Account Managers visited customers regularly and therefore had the best and most up-to-date information about any given customer and their ordering patterns.129 The customer service representatives then took all of the collected information and made a determination as to whether the order was suspicious and should be reported. Over time, Mallinckrodt enhanced the order investigation process and developed more formal due diligence policies. While NAMs were consulted regarding specific potentially suspicious orders, the controlled substances compliance group had the final say on whether or not to    the algorithm. There were a number of draft policies circulated and the algorithm multiplier changed from|    because theQ multiplier was unworkably over-inclusive. In my experience, this is not unusual.    127 Over time, the group responsible for monitoring shifted from customer service managers trained by the controlled    substances compliance group, to trade compliance and then to controlled substances compliance personnel. While it    was not improper for a customer service manager to perform the monitoring function, Mallinckrodt determined that it    would be better for monitoring to be conducted in compliance.    128RauschDep. Tr. at 71:10-72:12:    If an order was flagged as being peculiar, it was during my time, my job or responsibility to talk to    marketing or our customer service reps, who would be the first people that I would talk to because    they were in tuned to our customers and what their order needs were, and they would know if there    was anything unusual as far as a distributor picking up a new customer that they hadn't had before    that they would now need increased material to supply. And if our CSR did not have a ~ an answer    to why the customer was ordering more, I would go to the product manager, or business manager,    whatever they were being called at the time, who had that particular product that the order was for,    and I would ask them if they knew why all of a sudden we were having a peculiar order from that    customer. And a peculiar order, again, would be unusual quantity from what they have bought in    the past over a period of time based upon the log rhythms {sic} we set in place in our computer    system. If they didn't know, my next step would be going to the salesperson and asking them.    1291 have reviewed examples of such due diligence. I would note that due diligence is different for every order and    every customer, and it is not surprising to me that ordering patterns of wholesale and distributor customers changed    frequently. For example, a manufacturer exiting the market or a distributor obtaining a new customer could    significantly change customer order patterns.  MNK-T10007105639 (Carta Johnson in Logistics Planning emails    Kate Muhlenkamp and Vince Kaiman about increased orders as a result of Actavis supply issues, requesting insight    for the increases ""[bjecause this is a substantial increase, and we'll likely need to explain the cause."").    -24-     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1957-35  Filed:  07/23/19 29 of 43.

Second, to further enhance its program consistent with the new DEA guidance, Mallinckrodt revised its customer diligence processes in order to better ""know its customers."" This included new customer screening procedures and development of customer questionnaires132 and checklists for existing customers, as well as an automatic ""do not ship"" list for customers that Mallinckrodt determined that it should not sell to.133 It also included more training and involvement of the National Account Managers, who served as the ""boots on the ground"" gathering information about customers and reporting back to the Controlled Substances Compliance group.134 Based on my review of documents and procedures, Mallinckrodt's effort to know its customers crossed departments but decision-making power was retained by the Controlled Substances Compliance group with input from the legal department.135 Based on my experience, it is rational and appropriate for a company to include a broad group in such diligence efforts while, as here, decision-making power was retained by compliance and legal.    106. As Mallinckrodt continued to work to enhance its program based on the limited and changing DEA guidance, it also took affirmative steps when it received information suggesting the possibility of downstream diversion of its product. By way of example, on June 7, 2009, Mallinckrodt received an email from a Tennessee Police Officer alerting the Company   that   he   was   conducting   an   investigation   into   potential   diversion   of    130 Harper Dep.

And so if I knew of a circumstance that justified the reason for the additional order, or the peculiar order, then I'd discuss it with Karen and we would release the order. If not, we kind of kicked it up the chain and said, ""I can't figure out why they're ordering this,"" and then Karen would maybe get with marketing or whatever to resolve the problem."").    1311 understand that for a short time, peculiar orders may have been shipped before the investigation was complete although Mallinckrodt always completed the investigations. However, none of the shipped peculiar orders were found to be suspicious, and Mallinckrodt never shipped a suspicious order. MNK-T10000279153; Harper Dep. Tr. at 304:1-15.    132  Mr. Rafalski and Dr. Whitelaw criticize Mallinckrodt for removing a specific question regarding a customers' suspicious order monitoring program from the customer questionnaire in the course of the questionnaire development process.

PagelD #: 127962    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    pharmaceutical products and that he had discovered a bottle of Mallinckrodt product in the course of his investigation.136 The Tennessee Police Officer requested that Mallinckrodt assist him in attempting to determine the source of the product.137 Upon receipt of this request, Mallinckrodt immediately took action. Based on the lot number of the bottle, Mallinckrodt was able to research its shipping records and determine that only one distributor in Florida, Sunrise Wholesalers (""Sunrise"") had received product from that lot at that point in time.138 This, alone, of course, did not mean that product had been diverted from Sunrise, but Mallinckrodt took immediate steps to conduct due diligence on its customer.    107.   The very next day, Mallinckrodt placed a hold on the Sunrise account, cutting off all further shipments of Mallinckrodt product to Sunrise.139 Mallinckrodt's SOM Team then conducted an investigation into Sunrise, evaluating the information that Mallinckrodt had in its files while remaining in contact with the Tennessee Police Officer. Mallinckrodt's SOM Team learned that Sunrise employed a former DEA employee as a consultant who was responsible for ensuring that Sunrise sold to legitimate customers and took steps to ensure that Sunrise maintained effective controls against diversion. More importantly, Mallinckrodt learned that DEA had recently audited Sunrise and had offered no adverse findings.140 Based on this information, Mallinckrodt's SOM Team made the decision to resume shipments to Sunrise, but also decided that it would conduct an onsite audit of this customer.141    108.  Mallinckrodt's SOM Team promptly informed DEA of this information. Pete Kleissle, DEA St. Louis Diversion Investigator, informed Mallinckrodt that it ""had acted in a responsible way and he saw no issues with regard to this matter.""142 Mr. Kleissle was very complimentary of Mallinckrodt's commitment to an open dialogue with DEA and provision of information to law enforcement.143 With DEA's blessing, Mallinckrodt conducted an onsite audit of Sunrise in August of 2009. A team containing members of Mallinckrodt's compliance, sales, and data integrity groups reviewed Sunrise's building security, new customer screening process, suspicious order monitoring procedures, customer files, and DEA 222 forms. Mallinckrodt also spoke with Sunrise's onsite DEA consultant who was responsible for due diligence on Sunrise's customers.1441 have reviewed both the processes and conclusions of Mallinckrodt's on-site audit of Sunrise and it is consistent with how I conducted due diligence audits of registrants in my 50 years of industry experience.145 This proactive approach by Mallinckrodt demonstrates an    136 MNK-T10000562325.    137 Id.    138 Id.    139 MNK-T10000290242.    140 MNK-T10000562325.    141 Id.    142 Id.    143 Id.    144 MNK-T10000296090; MNK-T1_0000307243.    145  To the extent Plaintiffs' experts criticize Mallinckrodt's audit of Sunrise because it eventually surrendered its license to DEA, I find this hindsight criticism to be off base. My review indicates that Mallinckrodt conducted a thorough audit based on the information that was available to it. The fact that Sunrise surrendered its license nearly a    -26-     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1957-35 Filed: 07/23/19 31 of 43.  PagelD #: 127963    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    attempt to know its customers and engage in a partnership with law enforcement where evidence of diversion appears.    109. I understand that Mallinckrodt received positive feedback from DEA in 2009 and again in 2010, which illustrates that Mallinckrodt's program was in line with and exceeding DEA expectations and industry practice during this time. First, in a February 2009 meeting with Albany DEA, Diversion Investigator Heather White stated that she was ""content and impressed"" with Mallinckrodt's suspicious order monitoring and reporting mechanism.146 The following year, a DEA St. Louis Diversion Program Manager stated that Mallinckrodt had the ""best suspicious order monitoring process he has seen to date"" and ""what he expected from Mallinckrodt as an industry leader.""147 In my experience at DEA and as an industry consultant, positive feedback from DEA is meaningful and Mallinckrodt could rely on DEA's commentary as an indication of a sufficient suspicious order monitoring program.    110. Based on my experience at DEA and as an industry consultant, Mallinckrodt took the steps I would expect from a responsible registrant based on new DEA guidance lacking in specific direction. As I would expect, Mallinckrodt put together a cross-functional team to enhance the program in line with DEA's new guidance. At the same time, Mallinckrodt took actions that evidence good corporate citizenship when it learned of any potential issues with respect to one of its customers. Based on my experience, Mallinckrodt's anti-diversion program met the requirements of the regulation and statute, and went above and beyond industry standard for suspicious order monitoring during this time period.    11 Lit is my opinion that Mallinckrodt maintained sufficient and effective controls against diversion of controlled substances in the 2008-2009 time period.148    112. It is my opinion that Mallinckrodt's suspicious order monitoring system was sufficient and effective to detect and report suspicious orders to DEA in the 2008-2009 time period.    113. It is my opinion that Mallinckrodt appropriately utilized the information and data available to it in its controlled substances compliance program and its suspicious order monitoring program.    year later does not call into question the conclusions made by Mallinckrodt's team that were based on the facts available at the time.    146 MNK-T1_0000275446.    147 MNK-T1_0000421974.    1481 have reviewed the Victor Borelli email that is referenced in Dr. Whitelaw's report. MNK-T10000559532. Based on my experience and my review of Mallinckrodt's suspicious order monitoring program, the email referring to opioids as Doritos was a callous and inappropriate email that was inconsistent with Mallinckrodt's role as a dedicated leader of suspicious order monitoring and DEA compliance. In my review of the documents, I have seen no evidence that anyone at the company was aware that this statement was made, and I have no doubt that if the company were aware of the statement that it would have taken appropriate action. I have also reviewed the email regarding Mr. Borelli from Cathy Stewart cited in Dr. Whitelaw's report, MNK-T10003028219, and after reviewing Ms. Stewart's testimony I understand that she was not concerned that Mr. Borelli was providing information that was inaccurate in an effort to make sales.

It is my opinion that DEA guidance and industry standards evolved in the 2008-2009 time period and Mallinckrodt enhanced and upgraded its suspicious order monitoring and anti-diversion program to meet this changing DEA guidance and industry standards.    C.        2010-2011: Incorporation of Chargeback Data    1.         2010-2011 Regulatory Landscape    115. In the 2010-2011 time frame, there was no change to the CSA's anti-diversion requirements or suspicious order monitoring regulation.149 Accordingly, consistent with prior years, neither the CSA nor the suspicious order monitoring regulation suggested that manufacturers needed to take any action to police the supply chain beyond the orders from their customers.    2.         2010-2011 DEA Guidance    116. In the 2010-2011 time frame, DEA provided no further official guidance to industry. Manufacturers were still relying on the 2007 DEA Letter to understand DEA guidance. There was no DEA guidance requiring a registrant to know its customers' customers and no DEA guidance regarding an obligation or a suggestion that a registrant collect, maintain, and utilize downstream transactional data. Indeed, DEA witnesses have made clear that there was no such expectation and that they had not heard of such a requirement.150    117. The only time that Mallinckrodt heard the phrase ""know your customers' customers"" from DEA was in a one-off statement by a DEA Diversion Group Supervisor during a nonpublic audit where he told Mallinckrodt about a '""new direction' initiative whereby enforcement action will be aimed at all entities within the supply chain, including manufacturing registrants"" because ""[t]he expectation is becoming that suppliers have not only an obligation to know their customers but an additional responsibility to know their customers."" 151 The Diversion Group Supervisor provided no further information on what know your customers' customers means or looks like, and provided no detail on what it means to implement this developing expectation in an anti-diversion program.    118.1 am not aware of any other DEA field offices making a similar statement during this time period. In fact, I am aware of another DEA Diversion Investigator and Diversion Program    149 Rannazzisi Dep. Tr. Vol. 1 at 253:10-23; Prevoznik Dep. Tr.

PagelD #: 127965    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    Manager stating that there was no such requirement.152 Know your customers' customers was not something known to the industry prior to this point in time and the single mention by a DEA field office, later contradicted by another field office, does not appear to reflect a policy change. My understanding that there was no guidance from DEA that manufacturers should know their customers' customers is confirmed by DEA testimony in this case, which makes clear that there is no regulatory obligation, even to this day, for manufacturers to know their customers' customers.153    119. Based on my review of the documents and my expertise in the industry, there was no shift in DEA guidance in the 2010-2011 time period that would have created new obligations, including any obligation or expectation that manufacturers should monitor their customers' customers.    3.        2010-2011 Industry Standards    120. During this time, the industry standard was to monitor orders from your own direct customers. I am not aware of other manufacturers during this time period that monitored the downstream registrants that purchased the manufacturer's product from distributors. It was not standard industry practice for manufacturers to collect, maintain, or utilize any downstream transactional data for anti-diversion purposes because DEA had never mentioned the possibility of using downstream transactional data for these purposes.    121. Chargeback data is financial reconciliation data; it does not show ""orders"" placed to a manufacturer. Chargebacks are credits provided to distributors on certain sales for which the distributor's sale price is less than the amount they paid the manufacturer for the product.154 When submitting chargeback requests to manufacturers, distributors must provide manufacturers with information indicating how much product was sold and to whom.    122.1 have come to understand that there are significant limitations regarding chargeback data that make it ill-suited for use in a suspicious order monitoring program.155    a.   By the time manufacturers receive chargeback data from the distributor about a distributor-to-dispenser sale, that sale has already taken place. There is no opportunity for the manufacturer to ""halt"" or otherwise impact the transaction.    152    MNK-T10000270020 (Eileen Spaulding emails Karen Harper about a conversation with DI Heather White, who stated that she called NYC and no one there including Diversion Program Manager Sue Baker has heard anything about ""know your customers' customer"" and that the regulations do not reflect such a requirement.); Harper Dep.

PagelD #: 127966    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    b.   Manufacturers do not get chargeback data when they sell directly to the distribution centers of retail pharmacy chains.    c.    The data includes only that manufacturer's. Therefore, the data provides no context - e.g., it does not show what other opioids or non-opioid products manufactured by others the pharmacy is purchasing.    d.    The data only contains information about product the distributor shipped to the dispenser. It contains no information about how, by whom, or to whom the product is prescribed.    123.   Similarly, based on my experience in the industry, it was not standard practice for manufacturers to utilize prescription data for anti-diversion efforts. Prescription data does not show ""orders"" and DEA never suggested to industry that this data should be collected by manufacturers, analyzed as if they were orders, or utilized for anti-diversion purposes generally.    124.  Based on my experience within DEA and as a compliance consultant for industry, there was no industry standard of monitoring downstream transaction or purchases and no expectation that that would be part of an anti-diversion and/or suspicious order monitoring program during this time.    4.        2010-2011 Mallinckrodt Program    125.  In 2010 and 2011, Mallinckrodt continued to enhance its suspicious order monitoring program. At the same time, Mallinckrodt worked to create leading anti-diversion practices that allowed it to not only find out information about its customers but also find out information about downstream registrants that purchased Mallinckrodt product from Mallinckrodt's customers. I have reviewed Mallinckrodt's continuing enhancements and efforts to expand its anti-diversion program and evaluated that program and its efforts with respect to monitoring transactional data.    126.  As previously discussed, in 2009, in connection with the Sunrise audit, Mallinckrodt's Controlled Substances Compliance group became aware that its finance department possessed chargeback data to reconcile some downstream transactions.156 Mallinckrodt began to explore and evaluate the potential of using this financial data in its anti-diversion efforts. In 2010, Mallinckrodt began to see public news reports of diversion in Florida and its finance team undertook an analysis of this downstream data. Mallinckrodt discovered that its chargeback data could be used to help it better know its customers.157 While not all customers submit chargeback data on all downstream transactions, the transactions that were visible in the chargeback data showed the name and DEA number of the downstream entity, the type of product sold, the volume of product sold, the date    Harper Dep. Tr. at 353:9-20. Harper Dep. Tr. at 360:2-16.    -30-     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1957-35  Filed:  07/23/19 35 of 43.  PagelD #: 127967    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    of the sale.158 By understanding where its customers were selling Mallinckrodt product, Mallinckrodt was better equipped to scrutinize its customers' business practices.    127.  Based on what it learned from the chargeback data about customers' sales into the state of Florida, Mallinckrodt then took proactive steps with respect to three particular customers - Keysource, Masters, and Cedardale159 - that were shipping Mallinckrodt product to Florida. First, Mallinckrodt requested that the customers cease shipping oxycodone 15 mg and 30 mg dosage units to certain pharmacies and demanded an explanation for these sales.160 Then, Mallinckrodt conducted formal audits of all three customers.161 Finally, Mallinckrodt informed DEA about the steps it was taking with respect to each customer.162 Based on my experience, Mallinckrodt's customer audits went above and beyond common practices for manufacturers at the time, and set the industry standard for manufacturer audits of distributors.    128.  Despite conflicting suggestions from the DEA St. Louis Field Office and the DEA Albany Field Office about manufacturers knowing their customers' customers (see paragraphs 118-119) and no further guidance from DEA about what this meant or how to implement it, Mallinckrodt forged ahead to attempt to integrate chargeback data into its anti-diversion program to better understand where its products were being distributed.163 The Controlled Substances Compliance group worked closely with the finance department to run chargeback data reports, understand what the data showed and what to look for in the voluminous data, and evaluate whether and how the data could be incorporated in the anti-diversion program.    129.  Based on my review of documents and testimony, Mallinckrodt developed a chargeback monitoring program that went above and beyond DEA expectations. The program periodically reviewed chargeback data to look for high volume pharmacies or pharmacies whose transactional patterns raised questions. The program also reviewed certain other media and publically available information to identify downstream registrants that may pose a risk of diversion. Mallinckrodt shared its new chargeback monitoring initiative with the DEA St. Louis Field Office in 2010 and received feedback from the Diversion Program Manager that ""the information Mallinckrodt presented was the best Suspicious Order Monitoring process he has seen to date and what he expected from Mallinckrodt as an industry leader.""164    158 Buthusiem Rep. at 3-6.

PagelD #: 127968    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    130.  As part of this chargeback monitoring program, Mallinckrodt developed the ""chargeback restriction,"" a mechanism to disincentivize Mallinckrodt's customers from selling Mallinckrodt product to downstream pharmacies that may pose a risk of diversion.165 If Mallinckrodt decided to restrict chargebacks to a pharmacy, it would send a letter to distributors and to DEA, informing the distributors that it would not pay chargebacks to distributors who sold its product to the restricted pharmacy, in an effort to raise awareness of that pharmacy and spur further action by the distributors and perhaps DEA. Mallinckrodt did not have enough information to determine whether diversion was taking place, but used the chargeback restriction mechanism to identify the pharmacies for distributors and DEA based on its limited view through the chargeback data. In 2011, Mallinckrodt chargeback restricted more than thirty pharmacies in Florida and more than twenty pharmacies in other states.166    131.  In spring 2011, Mallinckrodt sought a meeting with DEA headquarters to share the work that it was doing on chargeback review and monitoring and its audits of distributors. On August 23, 2011, Mallinckrodt representatives from compliance, legal, and security met with DEA Office of Diversion Control and Quota section in Washington, DC.167 After Mallinckrodt presented its anti-diversion program, DEA asked Mallinckrodt to focus its anti-diversion efforts on its largest distributors and do more to address oxycodone diversion in Florida. 168    132.  After the meeting with DEA, Mallinckrodt took action immediately, both with respect to its own customers and with respect to downstream registrants. Mallinckrodt put together a plan to: (1) promptly suspend sales of Mallinckrodt oxycodone 15 mg and 30 mg tablets to distributors located in Florida; (2) set up in-person meetings with the larger distributors; (3) use chargeback data to identify the pharmacies purchasing the largest amounts of Mallinckrodt oxycodone 15 mg and 30 mg tablets inside and outside of Florida from Mallinckrodt's four largest distributor customers; (4) meet with those distributors and ask them to share their due diligence on each of those pharmacies; (5) conduct site-visits to certain Florida and Nevada pharmacies on that list to evaluate distributors' customer due diligence files on those pharmacies; and (6) chargeback restrict those pharmacies that Mallinckrodt believed, after its investigation and review of distributors' customer due diligence files, represented an unacceptable risk of diversion.169    133.  Based on my review of the documents and testimony, Mallinckrodt followed through on these plans.   Mallinckrodt suspended shipments as planned, met with its four largest    165 Ratliff Dep.

Mallinckrodt's security director at the time, Bill Ratliff, testified that ""the very next week I was in Florida... two of our forensic auditors to cover the east side of the state, because they had Spanish speaking ability, and I covered the west side of the state.""170 By early October 2011, Ratliff and his team had visited at least twenty pharmacies in Florida and Nevada.171 In September 2011 and again in November 2011, Mallinckrodt restricted chargebacks to distributors in connection with sales to certain pharmacies in and outside of Florida and shared those restriction letters with DEA.172 Throughout the fall of 2011 and into the first quarter of 2012, Mallinckrodt remained in regular communication with DEA and provided updates on its actions and initiatives.173    134. I understand that in late 2010, Mallinckrodt retained Howard Davis as a consultant to assist the company in continuing to enhance and improve Mallinckrodt's suspicious order monitoring program.174 It is my opinion that Mr. Davis's analysis and recommendations to Mallinckrodt175 made incorrect conclusions about Mallinckrodt's program, applied incorrect standards, and made incorrect recommendations for Mallinckrodt that were not consistent with DEA guidance to manufacturers or with industry standards at the time. For example, Mr. Davis copied and pasted a number of recommendations included in DEA guidance letters from 2006 and 2007 that related solely to distributors' pharmacy customers. For instance, Mr. Davis recommended that Mallinckrodt ask its distributor customers questions that were clearly meant for pharmacies, such as whether insurance plans are accepted and whether their customers are soliciting purchasers via the internet.176 Mr. Davis further suggested that Mallinckrodt ask its customers whether they self-medicated or were prescribing to family members.177 These recommendations demonstrate that Mr. Davis appears to have had no understanding of Mallinckrodt's business and was unable to comprehend the various entities that make up the controlled substances supply chain. In short, given Mr. Davis's lack of knowledge and understanding of the very manufacturing business upon which he was expected to consult, I conclude that any guidance he provided to Mallinckrodt was severely flawed and he did not add value as a consultant to the company.    170 Ratliff Dep.

It is my opinion that Mallinckrodt maintained sufficient and effective controls against diversion of controlled substances in the 2010-2011 time period.    136.  It is my opinion that Mallinckrodt's suspicious order monitoring system was sufficient and effective to detect and report suspicious orders to DEA in the 2010-2011 time period.    137.  It is my opinion that in the 2010-2011 time period Mallinckrodt appropriately utilized the information and data available to it in its controlled substances compliance program and its suspicious order monitoring program.    138.  It is my opinion that DEA guidance and industry standards evolved in the 2010-2011 time period and Mallinckrodt enhanced and upgraded its suspicious order monitoring and anti-diversion program to meet this changing DEA guidance and industry standards.    D.        2012 to 2018: Continuing Evolution and Enhancement    1.         2012-2018 Regulatory Landscape    139.  From 2012 to the present, there has been no change to the CSA's anti-diversion requirements or suspicious order monitoring regulation.178 Accordingly, consistent with prior years, neither the CSA nor the suspicious order monitoring regulation suggested that manufacturers needed to take any action to police the supply chain beyond the orders from their customers.    2.         2012-2018 DEA Guidance    140.  In the post-2012 time period, there has also been no further official guidance from DEA concerning anti-diversion and suspicious order monitoring obligations. In June 2012, DEA published a guidance letter reiterating the same information as the December 2007 letter.179 The June 2012 DEA Letter does not mention or suggest to manufacturers that they should know their customers' customers, and does not mention or suggest any obligation to collect, maintain, and utilize downstream transactional data as part of their anti-diversion or suspicious order monitoring programs. Essentially, the state of official DEA guidance remains unchanged since 2007.180    3.         2012-2018 Industry Standards    141.  Because DEA offered no further guidance, industry standards remained largely the same in the 2012-2018 time period. Based on my experience within DEA and as a compliance consultant for industry, there was no industry standard at this time for manufacturers to    178 Rannazzisi Dep. Tr.

Correct."").    179 ABDCMDL00269683.    180  Mr. Rafalski heavily relies on the Masters Pharmaceuticals decision in creating additional suspicious order monitoring obligations for registrants that are not stated in any regulations or DEA guidance. The Masters decision is not relevant to my opinions because it came out in 2017 and does not apply retroactively, and Mallinckrodt's program was consistent with the Masters decision.    -34-     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1957-35 Filed: 07/23/19 39 of 43.  PagelD #: 127971    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    monitor downstream registrants that purchased their product from distributors, and no expectation that such activity would be part of a compliance or suspicious order monitoring program during this time. In addition, it was not standard industry practice for manufacturers to collect, maintain, or utilize any downstream transactional data for anti-diversion purposes because DEA had never mentioned the possibility of using downstream transactional data for these purposes.    4.        2012-2018 Mallinckrodt Program181    142.  In 2012, Mallinckrodt further enhanced its anti-diversion and suspicious order monitoring efforts. First, Mallinckrodt revised its suspicious order monitoring algorithm to generate reports twice each business day, flagging orders based on number of orders per month and volume of orders per month.182 In September 2012, ""Do Not Ship"" controls were made automatic instead of manual so that an order could not be shipped while investigation was ongoing.183 In November 2012, the algorithm changed fromf! I         |, increasing the number of flagged orders, all of which Mallinckrodt conducted due diligence on prior to shipment.184 Mallinckrodt reported all flagged orders to DEA, sending reports twice each business day.185 Mallinckrodt has made continued revisions and improvements to its suspicious order monitoring process and procedures since 2012, the most recent in 2018.186    143.  In 2012, Mallinckrodt also expanded its customer audits, including audits of larger distributors.187    144.  Mallinckrodt also continued to restrict chargebacks to distributors in connection with sales by distributors to pharmacies nationwide that may be indicative of diversion.188 Each year from 2012 to the present, the company periodically identified pharmacies across the country to chargeback-restrict.189 Mallinckrodt formalized the chargeback restriction process and developed pharmacy information sheets to standardize the pharmacy investigation process.190 As discussed above, whenever Mallinckrodt put a pharmacy on its chargeback restriction list, it provided notice to all of Mallinckrodt's distributor customers as well as DEA.    1811 understand that neither Mr. Rafalski nor Dr. Whitelaw offer an opinion on Mallinckrodt's anti-diversion program after 2012 and no Plaintiffs' experts claim that Mallinckrodt's anti-diversion program did not meet DEA requirements and expectations after 2012.    82 MNK-T1_0002357607.    83 MNK-T1_0002357607.    84 MNK-T1_0005620500.    85 E.g., MNK-T10008509735; MNK-T1JJ002255019; MNK-T10008436462.    86   MNK-T10007476261   (October 2012  policy);  MNK-T10005620500   (November 2012  policy);  MNK-T10000511246 (2015 policy); MNK-T10004155833 (2018 policy).    87 MNK-T1_0008435608; MNKT1_0007727911. 88MNK-T1_0001384980.    89 MNK-T1_0008502183; MNK-T1_0007727449; MNK-T1_0007705938.    90 MNK-T10004155830; MNK-T1_0004155827.    -35-     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1957-35  Filed:  07/23/19 40 of 43.  PagelD #: 127972    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    145.  As an example of the chargeback restriction process, in October 2015, European Apothecary pharmacy came to Mallinckrodt's attention via media reports. Jennifer Buist of the Controlled Substances Compliance group consulted chargeback data and then sent distributors AmerisourceBergen, Bellco, and HD Smith a pharmacy information sheet requesting due diligence on European Apothecary.191 Bellco shortly thereafter returned the pharmacy information sheet, indicating that European Apothecary had been recently restricted internally due to similar media reports.192 Immediately after receiving the pharmacy information sheet from Bellco, Buist recorded this information about European Apothecary and contacted the appropriate colleagues to implement a chargeback restriction. Mallinckrodt sent a chargeback restriction letter concerning European Apothecary to all distributors.193 Mallinckrodt reported the chargeback restriction to DEA as well.194    146.  It is my opinion that Mallinckrodt maintained sufficient and effective controls against diversion of controlled substances 2012 to 2018.    147.  It is my opinion that Mallinckrodt's suspicious order monitoring system was sufficient and effective to detect and report suspicious orders to DEA from 2012 to 2018.    148.  It is my opinion that Mallinckrodt appropriately utilized the information and data available to it in its controlled substances compliance program and its suspicious order monitoring program from 2012 to 2018.    VIII. Mallinckrodt's 2017 Settlement Does Not Establish Or Recognize Any ""Know Your Customers' Customers"" Requirement And Does Not Change Opinion Regarding Mallinckrodt's Compliance With The CSA    149.  Based on my review of documents and deposition testimony in this case and Mallinckrodt's Memorandum of Agreement with DEA, Mallinckrodt made a limited admission in 2017 that at certain times prior to January 1, 2012, its program did not meet the standards outlined in the DEA guidance letters.195 Mallinckrodt does not admit that it has any obligation to know its customers' customers or monitor downstream transactional data.196 In the MO A, Mallinckrodt agreed to two different tasks: suspicious order reporting, required by DEA regulation, and chargeback monitoring, not required by DEA regulation.197    150.  In my experience with DEA and in industry, it is common for an entity to agree to a Memorandum of Agreement in order to avoid the burden of litigation and resolve a disagreement with the agency.    0002265146; MNK-T10001810925.    0002265149.    0007727449; MNK-T1_0007727447.    0002261388.    0000557100.    0000557100.    0000557100.    191 MNK-T1    192 MNK-T1    193 MNK-T1    194 MNK-T1    195 MNK-T1    196 MNK-T1    197 MNK-T1    -36-     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1957-35 Filed: 07/23/19 41 of 43.  PagelD #: 127973    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    151.  In my experience with DEA and in industry, it is possible for an entity to agree in a Memorandum of Agreement to do more than the relevant statute and regulations require. Furthermore, a Memorandum of Agreement is not binding on third parties and does not have the force of law.    152.  In my opinion, Mallinckrodt's limited admission in the 2017 settlement with DEA does not change my opinion that Mallinckrodt's anti-diversion program was consistent with anti-diversion regulations, guidance, and industry standards throughout the Review Period.    EX.      McCann and Keller Methodologies for Flagging Transactions    153.  I have also reviewed the Report and Supplemental Reports of Plaintiffs' experts Dr. Craig McCann and Lacy Keller. Dr. McCann and Ms. Keller claim to utilize five methodologies for identifying orders that could have been flagged within DEA's ARCOS data and Defendants' transaction data. Dr. McCann terms these methods as: ""Maximum Monthly, Trailing 6 Month Threshold,"" ""2x Trailing 12 Month average,"" ""Extraordinary Order Method - 3x Trailing 12 Month Average,"" ""Maximum 8,000 Dosage Units Monthly,"" and ""Maximum Daily Dosage Units.""198 These methodologies are pulled from Mr. Rafalski's expert report and no reason is given as to why any of these methodologies would be appropriate for any particular Defendant.199    154.  Neither Dr. McCann nor Ms. Keller offer any opinion as to whether any of the ""flagged"" transactions are, in fact, suspicious under the DEA' suspicious order monitoring regulation. However, Mr. Rafalski, without any analysis, simply adopts the analyses of both Dr. McCann and Ms. Keller and contends that each of the flagged orders is, in fact, suspicious.200 Each of these reports rests on assumptions that are fundamentally flawed. Notably, as both DEA and industry understood, suspicious order monitoring is not one-size-fits all. Each and every registrant has a different business model and different customer base. Therefore, attempting to apply simplistic formulas across numerous registrants without conducting an actual evaluation of each registrant's business model and customer base does not provide an accurate way to evaluate that registrant's orders. In fact, the flaws in this approach are highlighted by the fact that Dr. McCann and Ms. Keller apply the exact same formulas to both distributor and manufacturer registrants. As discussed earlier in this report, these different registrant classes have very different business models and customer bases. A manufacturer may sell to a few dozen distributors while a distributor may sell to tens of thousands of retail pharmacies. Dr. McCann and Ms. Keller simply ignore these essential differences. Throughout my experience, I understood that each registrant needed to be evaluated individually, and one could not apply a single suspicious order monitoring program to different registrants, and certainly not to difference classes of registrants. The regulatory guidance provided by DEA makes this fact clear as DEA expected each registrant to create its own system to determine when orders were actually suspicious.201 As such, the methodologies utilized    McCann Rep. at 56-72; Keller Rep. at 16-22. Rafalski Rep. at 41. Rafalski Rep. at 40-41. US-DEA-00001767; US-DEA-00005941.    -37-     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1957-35  Filed:  07/23/19 42 of 43.  PagelD #: 127974    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    by Dr. McCann and Ms. Keller are merely a subset of the various ways by which a registrant could analyze orders for further diligence as part of its suspicious order monitoring program.    155.  More importantly, Dr. McCann and Ms. Keller both base their reports on a flawed premise - that the registrants did not effectively investigate the flagged transactions. This assumption is based solely on the instruction of Plaintiffs' counsel as neither Dr. McCann nor Ms. Keller conducted any review of any Defendants' due diligence files.202 As such, neither Dr. McCann nor Ms. Keller has any idea whether the orders flagged by the methodologies were in fact investigated by the registrants.    156.  Furthermore, both Dr. McCann and Ms. Keller take this flawed assumption to an extreme and untenable position. As soon as one order is flagged, Dr. McCann and Ms. Keller assume that all subsequent orders should be flagged and again that no due diligence was conducted. I have never heard of such an approach to suspicious order monitoring. The CSA, DEA regulations, DEA guidance, and industry standards have never instructed or required manufacturers and distributors to stop selling controlled substances to a customer if one of that customer's orders is flagged by its suspicious order monitoring algorithm. In addition, this position appears to utilize a ""suspicious customer"" approach, whereas the applicable DEA regulation clearly is focused on monitoring and reporting individual orders. These flawed assumptions cause Dr. McCann and Ms. Keller to immensely overstate the number of orders flagged by each of their flawed methods. In short, the analyses done by Dr. McCann and Ms. Keller have no basis and are simply created based on faulty assumptions by Plaintiffs. I do not believe that they provide any useful information in evaluating the Defendants' suspicious order monitoring programs.    157.  It is my opinion that a suspicious order monitoring system that meets the regulations and expectations of DEA must be tailored to each individual registrant's business and the one-size-fits-all approach that Plaintiffs' counsel asked Dr. McCann and Ms. Keller to apply in their expert reports in this case is incorrect, is contrary to DEA guidance, and does not provide any useful information relating to suspicious orders for each of the Defendants.    202    Keller Rep. at 14; McCann Rep. at 20.    -38-     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1957-35  Filed:  07/23/19 43 of 43.

And what is your occupation,    18   and who is your employer?    19         A.     I'm currently a vice president    20   of regulatory affairs and compliance for    21   McKesson Corporation.    22         Q.     How long have you been employed    23   by McKesson?    24         a.     Since May of 2014.    25         Q.     Have you ever had your    12   Q.    13   A.    14   Q.    15   A.

So if you'll bear with me,    6   we're going to do a little bit of paperwork    7   to start --to start off.    8         A.     Okay.    9         Q.     The first thing is, is are you    10   aware that today you'll be testifying not as    11   Nate Hartle but as McKesson Corporation?    12         a.     I am.    13                 (McKesson-Hartle Exhibit 1    14         marked for identification.)    15   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    16         Q.     I'm going to have marked and    17   show you McKesson 30(b)(6) Document 1, and    18   this is the first notice of deposition that    19   was filed in this case.    2 0                                     Have you had a chance to review    21   this document before today?    22         a.     I do.  I have copies of this.    23          Q.     And you understand that today    24   I'll be asking you questions about the    25   subject matters that are in Exhibit 1, and    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 16     Case: k&j^<^4m&&Q&#^WiJfefitte$o <%G&Mk�*c$�?2a8?@m$t�$�&.    tew    1   McKesson has been kind enough to designate    2   you as its spokesman to answer these    3   questions?    4   MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    5   THE WITNESS:  I understand.    6   (McKesson-Hartle Exhibit 2    7   marked for identification.)    8   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    9   Q.     There's a second notice.  We'll    10   have that marked as Exhibit 2, and it's MCK    11   30(b)(6)_02.    12   Have you had a chance to review    13   this document before today?    14   A.     I have.    15   Q.     Now, it's my understanding that    16   McKesson has designated you to testify on    17   certain subject matters within this document    18   but not all.    19   Is that your understanding?    20   A.     Correct.    21   Q.     And those numbers are numbers    22   9, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22.    23   Is that your understanding as    24   well?    25   A.     Yes.

FARRELL:    4         Q.     The next document, just to be    5   fair, is I'm going to mark as Exhibit 3    6   McKesson's objections and responses to each    7   of these subject matters to create the whole    8   record, if anybody wants to see it.  This    9   will be McKesson 30(b)(6)_3.    10                 Have you had a chance to review    11   this document before today?    12         a.     I have.    13          Q.     It's much longer, isn't it?    14                 (McKesson-Hartle Exhibit 4    15         marked for identification.)    16   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    17         Q.     And finally, I'm going to show    18   you McKesson 3 0(b)(6)_4, which we've also    19   labeled as Exhibit 4, which is simply the    20   redesignation of the date and location and    21   the subject matters of today's deposition.    22                 Have you had a chance to review    23   this document?    24         a.     I have.    25                         Q.             So  that   everybody   is   on  the    Golkow  Litigation  Services    Page   18     Case: k&j^<^4m&&Q&#^Witfiifitte$o ^G&Mk2Q&�?2d8?@m$t�$�&iew    1   same page, what you'll notice is that there    2   are a number of different Bates stamps that    3   we'll see throughout the day.  For purposes    4   of this deposition, what we've done is we've    5   created a unique and separate Bates stamp    6   just for your deposition, which can be found    7   in the top right-hand corner of, I hope, all    8   of the exhibits today.  And some of them,    9   start MCK 30(b)(6) and then underscore, and    10   then the first number you'll see is the    11   sequential number of exhibits, followed by a    12   dash and then individual page numbers.    13                 As we go through later today, I    14   abandon the normal sequential numbering    15   system because we're going to bounce around    16   the timeline a little bit, and instead I use    17   basically a date indicator in the top    18   right-hand corner.    19         A.     Okay.    20         Q.     Now, that being said for    21   everybody on the telephone, a lot of these    22   documents have been produced in this    23   litigation, and what you'll find, to the best    24   of my ability, is I've always tried to find    25   the document that contains the MDL Bates    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 19     Case: fr�^m$-CmtM&&m#---1W�>^�i\e�o<%{&&&&<$�?2a8?@m$t�$&&.ew    1   stamp in the bottom right-hand corner.    2   Sometimes it's not been all that successful    3   because sometimes the document comes from a    4   prior production and has not yet matriculated    5   or made its way over to the MDL production.    6                 But nonetheless, those are the    7   three different Bates stamp numbering systems    8   that we're going to come across today, and    9   when I talk on the record, I'll try to refer    10   just to the MDL number.    11                 For the people on the telephone    12   and the record and then for you and I, it'll    13   be easiest for us to use the top right-hand    14   corner.    15         A.     Okay.    16         Q.     When did you first learn that    17   you would be designated as the corporate    18   witness for McKesson?    19         a.     I don't know the exact date,    20   but I believe within the last, say, 30 days    21   or so.    2 2        Q.     Do you know Gary Boggs? 2 3        A.     I do know Gary.    24         Q.     Are you aware that he has been    25   designated as a 30(b)(6) designee in another    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 2 0     Case: ^rn^-QSmt^mi^.m.#^Wi>^(^^b <%{&&&22<$�?2a8?@m$t�m7iew    1   litigation pending in West Virginia?    2         A.     I am aware.    3          Q.     Have you read the deposition of    4   McKesson from that litigation?    5         A.     I have.    6         Q.     Is there anything in that    7   deposition that you think is wrong or    8   factually inaccurate?    9         A.     Not that I can recall.    10         Q.     Are you prepared, sitting here    11   today, to adopt or affirm the representations    12   McKesson made in the West Virginia Attorney    13   General litigation?    14                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    15                 THE WITNESS:  Can you ask that    16          again, please?    17   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    18         Q.     So it's a little bit of a    19   Plato's Theory of the Forms right now, but    20   for all intents and purposes, McKesson is    21   sitting here in front of me today, and    22   McKesson was sitting before Mr. Lee Javins    23   from the West Virginia Attorney General    24   litigation pending in Boone County several    25   weeks ago.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 21     Case: k&j^<^4m&&Q&#^WiJfefitte$o <%G&Mk23&�?2a8?@m$t�$�&.    tew    1   And so I'm trying to make the    2   connection that sitting here today McKesson    3   affirms or adopts all of its testimony from    4   the West Virginia litigation.    5   MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    6   This witness is here on -- designated    7   on behalf of McKesson for the topics    8   you've indicated.    9   But you can answer the    10   question.    11   THE WITNESS:  I'm not sure how    12   to answer that question.    13   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    14   Q.     Okay.  So the answer is either    15   you adopt your testimony from the prior    16   litigation or you choose not to today.    17   MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    18   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    19   Q.     It's okay either way.    20   A.     What's that?    21   Q.     It's okay either way.    22   A.     Yeah.    23   Q.     It's just a question of whether    24   or not I'm going to go back through some of    25   the other subject matters that Gary Boggs    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 2 2     Case: k&j^<^4m&&Q&#^Witfiifitte$o^G&Mk2/k$�?2d8?@m$t�$�&iew    1      testified  to  or whether  or  not   I   can  rely  on    2      that   sworn  testimony   --    3                       A.            Okay.    4         Q.     -- to be applicable today.    5                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form,    6          and same comment as I made before.    7                 MR. FARRELL:  So, Counsel,    8          that's your second speaking objection,    9         and so I would ask that you keep your    10          comments from the record.    11   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    12         Q.     So it's okay if you do not want    13   to adopt that prior testimony.  We can go    14   through it today.  You may not have the    15   authority by McKesson to do so.    16         A.     Yeah.  Again, I'm not sure how    17   to answer that question specifically.    18         Q.     It's not a problem.    19         a.     Yeah.  Okay.    2 0        Q.     Can you tell me what documents    21   you reviewed to prepare for today's    22   testimony?    23                 MS. HENN:  I'm going to object    24          to that question as calling for    25         attorney work product and instruct the    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 2 3     Case: k&j^<^4m&&Q&#^Witfiifitte$o ^{&L#k25&�?2a8?@m$t�$&Piew    1         witness not to respond if you're being    2          asked, as I understand you are, for a    3          list of documents counsel showed you.    4   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    5         Q.     Okay.  Have all of the    6   documents that counsel shared with McKesson    7   been disclosed in the MDL?    8                 MS. HENN:  Do you mean to ask    9         whether the documents Mr. Hartle has    10         used in preparing for the deposition,    11         have they been produced?    12                 MR. FARRELL:  Yes.    13                 MS. HENN:  I believe that to be    14          the case, yes.    15   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    16         Q.     Okay.  So is it fair to say    17   that everything Mr. Hartle reviewed has    18   actually been produced in the litigation    19   today?    20                 MS. HENN:  That is my    21         understanding.    22                 MR. FARRELL:  The reason I ask    23          is because when I read Mr. Boggs'    24          testimony, there are references to a    25         dozen or so documents that he relied    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 24     Case: k&j^<^4m&&Q&#^Witfiifitte$o^G&Mk2%$�?2a8?@m$t�m}-iew    1                    upon  and discussed that  have  not  yet    2                    been  disclosed  in  the MDL.    3                                   Are  you  aware   of   any  documents    4                    that  are  pending  that  have  not  been    5         produced?    6                 MS. HENN:  I know that we're    7         not complete with our productions, but    8          I'm not -- I don't know what those    9         documents -- what documents you're    10          referring to.    11                 MR. FARRELL:  So to the extent    12          that there are future documents that    13          are produced that are relevant to the    14          subject matters that are in the    15          30(b) (6) notices, we reserve our right    16          to petition the Court for good cause    17          to extend or continue this deposition.    18                 MS. HENN:  I note your    19          reservation of rights.  We may    20         disagree on the ability of plaintiffs    21          to continue this deposition, but let's    22          continue.    23   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    24         Q.     Other than the documents    25   provided by counsel to you in preparation for    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 2 5     Case: ^tn^^S^^^^m.#^Wi^^^b <%G&Mk&&�?2d8?@m$t��&iew    1   this deposition, did you on your own review    2   any documents?    3         A.     Yes, I reviewed a handful of    4   documents that are standard with our program.    5         Q.     Okay.  Can you tell me which    6   ones they are?    7         A.     Can I ask a clarifying    8   question?  Can you repeat --do the documents    9   that had already -- documents that haven't    10   been produced?  Anything in addition to    11   what --    12         Q.     That would be a swell place to    13   start.    14         a.     You know, as I think about    15   things that I've reviewed, it's standard    16   operating manuals and procedures, and I think    17   likely all that -- that stuff is part of what    18   was produced, so I don't --    19         Q.     That's actually not a very fair    20   way to place it because you probably haven't    21   studied the production list yet from    22   McKesson.    23         A.      No.  No.    24         Q.     So let's talk about it in a    25   different context.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 2 6     Case: ^tn^^S^^^^m.#^Wi^^^b<%G&Mk2*&�?2a8?@m$t��&iew    1         A.     Okay.    2         Q.     I'm assuming at some point in    3   time your counsel provided you some documents    4   that they culled through based upon the legal    5   documents, and that, arguably, has been the    6   subject of some debate between the lawyers on    7   whether that list is producible or not.    8                 Aside from that, did you    9   independently go and review anything on your    10   own, document-wise, to prepare for today?    11         A.     Document-wise?  You know, I    12   looked at files of mine, you know, just, you    13   know, what I -- what I have in my own, you    14   know, storage on things that I've done or    15   projects that I've been on and reviewed just    16   a variety of different pieces of information    17   that personally I have.    18         Q.     Where would those files be    19   located?    2 0        A.     On my computer, whether it be    21   e-mails or in documents on my standard    22   storage on my computer.    23          Q.     Would it be documents from    24   MCK.NET?    25         A.     I don't think there was    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 2 7     Case: ^tn^^S^^^^m.#^Wi^^^b <%G&Mk2%$�?2a8?@m$t�$&fc.ew    1       anything  stored  on  MCK.NET,   our   intra   --   the    2       company's   intra   site.    3                    Q.           I   just  wanted  to  say MCK.NET.    4         A.     MCK.NET, yeah.    5         Q.     Did you review documents that    6   were on your personal computer -- that's a    7   bad question.    8                 Did you review documents that    9   are located on your hard drive of your    10   computer?    11         A.     My work computer?    12         Q.     Yes.    13         a.     Yes.    14         Q.     Would those documents also have    15   been on the server?    16         A.     Could you clarify ""server""?    17         Q.     Yeah.  So in general, when you    18   have a network of computers, sometimes    19   there's a central repository where    20   everybody's computer can pull up files from,    21   and then there's also on your own computer a    22   hard drive that nobody else can look at,    23   except you, from your computer station.    24         a.     I understand that, sir, but    25   I -- you know, in terms of the shared    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 2 8     Case: ^tn^^S^^^^m.#^Wi^^^b ^G&Mk2Q&�?2d8?@m$t��&iew    1   repository that we use in regulatory affairs,    2   yes, there's documents stored on there that    3   I've reviewed.    4         Q.     What about documents on your    5   personal hard drive on your office computer?    6         A.     Yes, I store documents on my    7   personal office computer.    8         Q.     And those documents you    9   reviewed prior to today's deposition?    10                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    11                 THE WITNESS:  There are some    12          documents.    13   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    14         Q.     Did you rely on any of those    15   documents or did any of those documents    16   refresh your recollection about the subject    17   matters of today's deposition?    18         a.     I used --    19                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form. 2 0                                      Go ahead.    21                 THE WITNESS:  I used them to    22          refresh.    23   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    24         Q.     Okay.  How about e-mails?  Did    25   you go and review any old e-mails?    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 2 9     Case: ^rn^-QSmt^mi^.m.#^Wi>^(^^b <%G&Mk2l<$�?2a8?@m$t�$&&.ew    1         A.     I may have looked at a few    2   e-mails.    3          Q.     Do any of them particularly    4   stand out?    5         A.     No.    6         Q.     who would the e-mails have come    7   from that you were reviewing?    8                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    9                 THE WITNESS:  Could be a    10         variety of people.  I don't recall,    11         you know, specific e-mails that I    12          looked at.  Could be from my team or    13         part of a project or...    14   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    15         Q.     And I'm sorry if I asked this    16   before.  How long have you been with    17   McKesson?    18         A.     Since 2014.  May of 2014.    19         Q.     You understand that some of the    20   subject matters today may predate 2014?    21         A.     I do understand that.    22         Q.     Other than documents provided    23   by your lawyer, where did you find documents    24   that predated 2014?    25                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 3 0     Case: k&j^<^4m&&Q&#^Witfiifitte$o <%{&&&22<$�?2a8?@m$t�m7iew    1                 THE WITNESS:  They would be on    2          our shared drive or our space where    3          regulatory affairs -- it's called the    4         R drive.  That's where we would share    5          information.    6   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    7         Q.     Okay.  Other than the R drive,    8   where else would we find those documents?    9                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    10                 THE WITNESS:  I'm not sure -- I    11         don't believe I accessed anything else    12          outside of the hard drive.  I know    13          there's other sites, a share point    14          site in the past, but I believe mine    15         were all from the R drive.    16   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    17         Q.     Have you reviewed any documents    18   or seen any documents that predate 2006?    19         a.     I have.    2 0        Q.     And did you -- where did those    21   documents come from?    22                 I'll make it easier.  Did those    23   documents come from the lawyers?    24         a.     I have some in the -- the -- my    25   preparation over the past few days, but also    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 31     Case: ^tn^^S^^^^m.#^Wi^^^b<%G&Mk23&�?2a8?@m$t�$&&.ew    1   I do have documents, as I joined McKesson,    2   that I reviewed and had stored either on my    3   personal computer, on my work computer, or    4   the R drive that predate 2006.    5         Q.     All right.  So we're going to    6   jump into some topics.    7         A.     Okay.    8         Q.     Have you read the Masters    9   Pharmaceutical case?    10         a.     Not for a while.  I read it    11   when it first came out, you know.    12         Q.     That was June of 2 017.    13                 So when I start asking    14   questions, I'm going to do my very best to    15   keep envisioning McKesson's logo sitting in    16   front of me instead of Nate Hartle.    17         a.     Okay.    18         Q.     So let me ask a different way.    19                 Is McKesson aware of the    20   publishing of the Masters Pharmaceutical    21   case?    22                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    23                 THE WITNESS:  We are.    24   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    25         Q.     You're aware that in Masters    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 32     Case: ni^hTf QS^ffm&&&#^Wt?fefitte$o ^G&Mk2/k$�?2a8?@m$t��&iew    1      Pharmaceutical   there was  a  discussion  of  the    2      reporting  requirement?    3                       A.            I   am.    4         Q.     And does McKesson acknowledge    5   that is the law in the United States?    6                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    7                 THE WITNESS:  Could you ask    8          that question again, please?  Do I --    9   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    10         Q.     Sure.    11                 I'm jumping out of order a    12   little bit, but I'm going to see if I can    13   actually grab the folder for you.    14                 We're not going to premark this    15   because that will absolutely mess up my    16   numbering system, but the top right-hand    17   corner it's Bates stamped 2017_06_30.    18                 And I apologize for the    19   flopping of the documents across the big    20   table.    21                 This is Masters Pharmaceutical.    22   Has McKesson read this document?    23                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    24                 THE WITNESS:  I believe that    25          several have read this document.

Have you read this document in    3   preparation for today's deposition?    4         A.     Did I have it in the past?    5         Q.     No.    6                 In preparation for today's    7   deposition, have you read this as McKesson's    8   corporate designee?    9         A.     I did not read this specific    10   right before the deposition.    11         Q.     So it's not -- it's not a    12   memory contest --    13         A.     Right.    14         Q.     -- and that's why I brought the    15   documents --    16         A.     Right.    17         Q.     --so that -- so that we can    18   talk about some of the subject matters.    19                 The first thing I'd like you to    20   do is turn to the Bates stamp page 7.  And    21   you'll notice that there are two columns, and    22   in the bottom right-hand corner the paragraph    23   heading number 2.    24                 Do you see that?    25         a.     Yes.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 34     Case: ^tn^^S^^^^m.#^Wi^^^b<%G&Mk2%$�?2a8?@m$t�$miew    1         Q.     And midway down through, you'll    2   see that in the parentheses it says the    3   ""reporting requirement.""    4         A.     I see that.    5         Q.     Do you see it?    6         A.     I do.    7         Q.     And then immediately after    8   that, it describes what the reporting    9   requirement is.  And I don't know if you do    10   better reading it aloud or reading it to    11   yourself.    12                 Would you like me to read it,    13   or would you like to read it?    14         a.     I can read it.    15         Q.     All right.  Starting with ""the    16   reporting requirement is a relatively modest    17   one,"" will you finish the sentence?    18         a.     I read that sentence.    19         Q.     Okay.  Now, will you read it    20   aloud?    21         A.     ""It requires only that a    22   distributor provide basic information about    23   certain orders to DEA so that DEA    24   investigators in the field can aggregate    25   reports from every point along the legally    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 3 5     Case: ^rn^-QSmt^mi^.m.#^Wi>^(^^b <%G&Mk&&�?2a8?@m$t�mZiew    1   regulated supply chain and use the    2   information to ferret out potentially illegal    3   activity.""    4         Q.     Does McKesson acknowledge that    5   it has a duty under the reporting    6   requirement?    7                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    8                 THE WITNESS:  Acknowledge that    9         we -- we, as part of the designing and    10         operating the suspicious order system,    11         have to report suspicious orders.    12   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    13          Q.     That wasn't my question.    14                 My question is:  Does McKesson    15   acknowledge the reporting requirement, as you    16   just read aloud, is a duty owed by McKesson    17   under the federal regulations and United    18   States Code?    19                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    20                 THE WITNESS:  And it's our    21          responsibility to report suspicious    22          orders.    23   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    24         Q.     So the answer to my question is    25   yes --    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 3 6     Case: k&j^<^4m&&Q&#^WiJfefitte$o<%G&Mk2*&�?2a8?@m$t�m?iew    1   A.   Yes.    2   Q.   -- no, or I don't know.    3      MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    4      THE WITNESS:  It is our -- yes.    5   QUESTIONS   BY MR. FARRELL:    6   Q.   Okay.  Now, I want you to go    7   down, and   if you actually flip the page,    8   we'll cheat to the end, and it's the end of     9   the first   sentence in the top left-hand    10   corner.   In parentheses it says, ""The    11   shipping   requirement.""    12      Do you see that?    13   A.   Where am I looking again?    14   Sorry.       15   Q.   Very top left-hand corner    16   there's a       17   A.   Okay.  Shipping requirement.  I    18   see that.       19   Q.   All right.  Now what we're    20   going to   do is go to the beginning of that    21   sentence   on the previous page, and it's the    22   last full   sentence.  It starts with ""once a    23   distribut   or has.""    24      Do you see that sentence?    25   A.   I see that.

Now I'm going to give you a    2   chance to read it without -- and digest it    3   for a second.    4         A.     I've read that.    5         Q.     All right.  Now, can you read    6   it aloud for the record?    7         A.     ""Once a distributor has    8   reported a suspicious order, it must make one    9   of two choices, decline to ship the order or    10   conduct some due diligence, and if it is able    11   to determine that the order is not likely to    12   be diverted into illegal channels, ship the    13   order.""    14         Q.     Does McKesson acknowledge that    15   the shipping requirement is a duty it owes    16   under the United States Code and the Code of    17   Federal Regulations?    18                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    19                 THE WITNESS:  Yes.    20                 (McKesson-Hartle Exhibit 5    21         marked for identification.)    22   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    23          Q.     We'll come back to this later.    24                 All right.  The next document    25   we're going to reference is MCK 30(b)(6)_5.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 3 8     Case: k&j^<^4m&&Q&#^Witfiifitte$o0?(^^^Q^i^?der^�Sft^f^lew    1       And  so  to make  this  easy  so  I   don't  have  to    2       say all   those   letters  and numbers,   as  we move    3       forward  I'm  just  going  to   refer  to   it   exhibit    4       such-and-such.    5                       A.            Okay.    6         Q.     And when I do, we're talking    7   about the exhibit for this deposition.    8                 I'm going to represent to you    9   that there are four pages to this exhibit,    10   that you won't find this exhibit anywhere on    11   the Internet because I made them myself.  I'm    12   going to give you a second to flip through    13   them, and what I'm going to represent to you    14   is that these are four different provisions    15   from four different United States Code    16   provisions.  So I'll give you a second to    17   review.    18         A.     Okay.    19         Q.     So the first thing I want you    20   to take note of on Exhibit 5, page 1, is the    21   top left-hand corner, which is the great seal    22   of our United States Congress.    23                 And if you look under the    24   United States Code, Title 21, for food and    25   drugs, under Chapter 13, Drug Abuse    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 3 9     Case: ^rn^-QSmt^mi^.m.#^Wi>^(^^b <%G&Mk�i<$�?2a8?@m$t�mfc.ew    1   Prevention and Control, Subchapter 1, Control    2   and Enforcement, Part A, Introductory    3   Provisions, this is the beginning of the    4   Controlled Substances Act.    5                 McKesson is aware of and    6   acknowledges that its role in the chain of    7   distribution of opioids is governed by the    8   Controlled Substances Act, agreed?    9                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    10                 THE WITNESS:  Yes.    11   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    12         Q.     Now, I'm going to have you look    13   down all the way at all those letters and    14   numbers at the very bottom, Public Law    15   91-513, Title 2.  And the date there is    16   October 27, 1970.    17                 McKesson is aware that the    18   Controlled Substances Act has been in force    19   and effect since 1970, correct?    20                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    21                 THE WITNESS:  Correct.    22   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    23          Q.     So Section 801, which is on the    24   first page, is Congressional findings and    25   declarations regarding controlled substances.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 4 0     Case: ^rn^-QSmt^mi^.m.#^Wi>^(^^b <%G&Mk�2<$�?2a8?@m$t�m7iew    1                 Do you see that?    2         A.     I do.    3          Q.     And it says, ""The Congress    4   agrees makes the following findings and    5   declarations.""    6                 And to be fair, paragraph 1,    7   will you read it aloud?    8         A.     ""Many of the drugs included    9   within this subchapter have a useful and    10   legitimate medical purpose and are necessary    11   to maintain the health and general welfare of    12   the American people.""    13          Q.     Does McKesson acknowledge and    14   agree with that finding?    15                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    16                 THE WITNESS:  Yes.    17   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    18         Q.     Now, will you read Section 2    19   aloud, please?    20         a.     ""The illegal importation,    21   manufacture, distribution and possession and    22   improper use of controlled substances have    23   substantially and detrimentally effect --    24   have a substantial and detrimental effect on    25   the health and general welfare of the    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 41     Case: k&j^<^4m&&Q&#^Witfiifitte$o<%G&Mk�3&�?2a8?@m$t�m&.ew    1   American people.""    2         Q.

FARRELL:    7         Q.     So you'll notice in paragraph 2    8   it includes distribution, correct?    9         A.     Correct.    10         Q.     And McKesson is engaged in the    11   distribution business, agreed?    12         a.     We are.    13          Q.     And that if they do not follow    14   the law as provided by the US code and the    15   Code of Federal Regulations, it has a    16   substantial and detrimental effect on the    17   health and general welfare of the American    18   people, agreed?    19                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    20                 THE WITNESS:  Could you restate    21          that question for me, please?    22   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    23          Q.     Yeah.    24                 You agree with paragraph 2 --    25         A.     Right.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 4 2     Case: k&j^<^4m&&Q&#^Witfiifitte$o0?(S3&ferH$i#2der^�ift#t^�^ew    1         Q.     --as McKesson's    2   representative, correct?    3         A.     Correct.    4         Q.     And what it says is that the    5   illegal, and one of the words is    6   distribution, of controlled substances has a    7   substantial and detrimental effect on the    8   health and general welfare of the American    9   people.    10                 I'm asking you if McKesson    11   agrees and acknowledges with this finding by    12   Congress in 1970.    13                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    14                 THE WITNESS:  Yes, that the    15          illegal distribution can -- could    16         potentially have an impact on the    17         American --    18   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    19         Q.     Well, it doesn't say    20   ""potential"" in paragraph 2, does it?    21         A.     It doesn't.    22         Q.     it says that if you break the    23   law, it has a substantial and detrimental    24   effect on the health and general welfare of    25   the American people.

That's  what   it   says,   correct.    2                       Q.            Does  McKesson  agree  and    3      acknowledge   that   finding?    4                                        MS.

Now, if you flip to page 2,    8   this is section A 12 of the Controlled    9   Substances Act, and what it says is it places    10   drugs into one of several categories.    11                 Is McKesson aware of the    12   scheduling of controlled substances?    13         a.     We are.    14         Q.     Okay.  And what we're dealing    15   with in this litigation primarily today are    16   Schedule II drugs, correct?    17         a.     Correct.    18         Q.     Now, there was a period of time    19   when certain hydrocodone combination products    20   were Schedule III, but they've since been    21   reclassified as Schedule II, agreed?    22         a.     Agreed.    23          Q.     And McKesson picked up a book    24   of business when that happened on the HCPs,    25   agreed?

HENN:  Objection to form.    2   THE WITNESS:  Can you rephrase    3   the book of business and the question    4   a little bit?    5   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    6   Q.     Yeah, that was a little too    7   country.    8   Is McKesson aware that its    9   sales of hydrocodone combination products    10   rose following the reclassification of those    11   opioids from Schedule III to Schedule II?    12   A.     Yes.    13   Q.     So nonetheless, when we're    14   talking about these products, I'm referencing    15   Schedule II for today.    16   A.     Understood.    17   Q.     So the Schedule II has a    18   definition, does it not, under the United    19   States Code?    20   A.     It does.    21   Q.     There's three aspects to it.    22   Do you see those three aspects?    23   A.     I do.    24   Q.     Could you read aspect A?    25   A.     ""The drug or other substance    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 4 5     Case: fr�^m$-CmtM&&m#---1W�>^�i\e�o<%G&Mk&&�?2d8?@m$t�$�&iew    1   has a high potential for abuse.""    2         Q.     McKesson is aware since 1970    3   that it was engaging in business of    4   distributing Schedule II controlled    5   substances which have a high potential for    6   abuse, agreed?    7         A.     Agreed.    8         Q.     And you agree that the opioids,    9   whether they're Schedule II or formerly    10   Schedule III, are drugs that have a high    11   potential for abuse?    12         a.     Agree.    13          Q.     McKesson knows this?    14         a.     We do.    15         Q.     And McKesson has known this    16   from the very beginning of their decision to    17   distribute controlled substances?    18         a.     Agreed.    19         Q.     Would you read paragraph B,    20   please?    21         A.     ""The drug or other substance    22   has a currently accepted medical use and    23   treatment in the United States or a currently    24   accept medical use with severe restrictions.""    25         Q.

""Abuse of a drug or other    8   substances may lead to severe psychological    9   or physical dependence.""    10         Q.

FARRELL:    15         Q.     So just to be clear, when we're    16   talking about controlled substances in this    17   litigation, we're talking about opiates and    18   opioids, agreed?    19         a.     Agreed.    20         Q.     And what these are, are these    21   are derivatives of opium in the form of a    22   pill, agreed?    23                 MS.

Well -- and it's okay if -- I'm    8   just trying to figure out what McKesson    9   knows.    10                 McKesson distributes pills from    11   a manufacturer to pharmacies.  That's what    12   they do, yes?    13         A.     Correct.    14         Q.     The pills that you're    15   distributing, you're aware they originally    16   come from the poppy plant?    17                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    18         Outside the scope.    19                 THE WITNESS:  I'm not an expert    20          in the medical field and design, but I    21         understand that, yes.    22   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    23          Q.     Does McKesson acknowledge or    24   appreciate that what they're selling are    25   opium pills?

HENN:      Objection  to   form.    2                                        THE  WITNESS:      We  understand    3                how   --   what's   in  the  pills,   so,   yes.    4   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    5         Q.     Okay.  So the opium can be    6   manipulated by the manufacturers to be    7   opiate-like?  Opiate-like, right?  There's    8   opiates and opioid, or opiate-like, and    9   that's how you get hydrocodone and oxycodone    10   and all the different types of opium pills,    11   agreed?    12         A.     Correct.    13                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    14   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    15         Q.     So when I say ""opium pills,""    16   what I'm talking about is the big    17   classification of all of these pills derived    18   from the poppy plant.    19                 Is that fair? 2 0        A.     Understood.    21         Q.     All right.  And when we talk    22   about any of the individual pills, whether    23   it's hydrocodone or oxycodone, those all fall    24   within the opium pill umbrella, right?    25                 MS.

FARRELL:    3          Q.     So when McKesson is    4   distributing opium pills, it knows and    5   understands that these pills have a high    6   potential for abuse?    7         A.     We do.    8         Q.     Now, they also -- you also --    9   McKesson understands that these pills do have    10   an accepted medical use in treatment, but    11   they have severe restrictions, agreed?    12                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    13                 THE WITNESS:  We understand the    14          language, yes.    15   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    16         Q.     You understand the language of    17   paragraph B?    18         A.     Right.    19         Q.     Opium pills have a place in    20   current medical practice?    21         A.     Yes.    22         Q.     But abusing opium pills may    23   lead to severe psychological and physical    24   dependence?    25         A.     Correct.

Yes.    4         Q.     And that's why the unlawful    5   distribution of these opium pills, relating    6   back to page 1, has a substantial and    7   detrimental effect on the health and general    8   welfare of the American people.    9                 Does McKesson acknowledge that?    10                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    11                 THE WITNESS:  Yes.    12   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    13          Q.     Now we're going to flip to    14   page 3, which is Section 821, rules and    15   regulations.    16                 Will you please read this    17   aloud?    18         A.

What is the date?    4   A.     October 27, 1970.    5   Q.     Does McKesson acknowledge that    6   Congress gave the United States Attorney    7   General the authority to promulgate rules    8   regarding the distribution of opium pills?    9   MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    10   THE WITNESS:  Yes.    11   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    12   Q.     Now let's flip to the next    13   page.  This is the -- this is where we'll be    14   spending most of our time today.  This is    15   page 4, Section 823.    16   This is from the United States    17   Code, and it includes, as you'll see down in    18   paragraph 1, what Congress has said is    19   McKesson's duty.  I'd like you to first read    20   that to yourself.    21   A.     I've read it.    22   Q.     All right.  Does McKesson    23   acknowledge that it has a duty to maintain    24   effective control against diversion of opium    25   pills as mandated by Congress?

FARRELL:    7         Q.     Now this is a much bigger    8   document, but I promise we won't go through    9   every page.    10                 This is going to be marked as    11   Exhibit 6 in the bottom right-hand corner,    12   and in the top right-hand corner it's MCK    13   30(b)(6)_6.    14                 For our fans following on the    15   telephone, this is the Congressional history    16   that can be found at 91-1444.  It is Public    17   Law 91-513.    18                 Do you remember when we were    19   looking at the United States Code and it    20   referenced Public Law 91-513 from Exhibit 5?    21         A.     Yes.    22         Q.     This is that document, I'll    23   represent to you.    24         a.     Okay.    25         Q.     And what this is, is this is    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 5 3     Case: fr�^m$-CmtM&&m#---1W�>^�i\e�o^G&Mk�5($�?2a8?@m$t��5Piew    1   the Congressional history of all those codes    2   that we just walked through.  And I'm not    3   going to ask you to read the entire document    4   because I've highlighted certain sections for    5   you.    6                 The first thing I'd like you to    7   do is I'd like for you to turn to Bates stamp    8   page 5.  And while you read the document to    9   yourself, I'm going to read it out loud to    10   save you some time.    11         A.     Okay.    12         Q.     Under Title 2, Control and    13   Enforcement, it states, ""The bill provides    14   for control by the Justice Department of    15   problems related to drug abuse through    16   registration of manufacturers, wholesalers,    17   retailers and all others in the legitimate    18   distribution chain and makes transactions    19   outside the legitimate distribution chain    20   illegal.""    21                 Does McKesson acknowledge this    22   finding from Congress?    23                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    24                 THE WITNESS:  Yes. 25    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 54     Case: ^rn^-QSmt^mi^.m.#^Wi>^(^^b <%G&Mk�%$�?2a8?@m$t��&iew    1   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    2         Q.     I'm going to have you to turn    3   to Bates stamp page 8.  And again, these are    4   my highlights.  Congress didn't highlight    5   this in 1970; Paul Junior did.  So while you    6   read it, I'm going to read it out loud.    7                 ""The bill was designed to    8   improve the administration and regulation of    9   the manufacturing, distribution and    10   dispensing of controlled substances by    11   providing for a closed system of drug    12   distribution for legitimate handlers of such    13   drugs.  Such a closed system should    14   significantly reduce the widespread diversion    15   of these drugs out of the legitimate channels    16   into the illicit market, while at the same    17   time providing the legitimate drug industry    18   with a unified approach to narcotic and    19   dangerous drug control.""    20                 Does McKesson acknowledge the    21   truth of this finding by Congress?    22                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    23                 THE WITNESS:  Yes.    24   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    25         Q.     So let's just talk about this    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 5 5     Case: ^tn^^S^^^^m.#^Wi^^^b<%G&Mk&&�?2a8?@m$t��&iew    1   for a minute.    2                 McKesson understands that in    3   1970 Congress created a closed system,    4   agreed?    5         A.     Agree.    6         Q.     What a closed system means is    7   that laissez-faire economics don't apply,    8   agreed?    9                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    10                 THE WITNESS:  Have to refresh    11         my memory on laissez-faire economics.    12   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    13          Q.     It's just a fancy French word    14   for ""hands off.""  The government is    15   intervening in the marketplace of the chain    16   of distribution for opium pills, agreed?    17         a.     For controlled substances.    18         Q.     Well, for all controlled    19   substances --    20         A.     Correct.    21         Q.     -- but today we're talking    22   about opium pills.    23         A.     Understood.    24         Q.     So the controlled substances    25   are in a chain of distribution that are    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 5 6     Case: ^rn^-QSmt^mi^.m.#^Wi>^(^^b <%G&Mk�*c$�?2a8?@m$t��&iew    1   closed off to the rest of the marketplace.    2   McKesson acknowledges that?    3                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    4                 THE WITNESS:  Correct.  It's a    5          closed system.    6   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    7         Q.     And in order to participate in    8   the closed system, you have to be one of the    9   select few that gets a registration    10   certificate from the DEA, agreed?    11         A.     Agreed.    12         Q.     And the reason Congress did    13   this was to reduce diversion.  Does McKesson    14   acknowledge that?    15                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    16                 THE WITNESS:  Yes, I believe    17          that was the overall intent.    18   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    19         Q.     So it's creating rules to    20   prevent diversion to the best of their    21   ability.  McKesson acknowledges that fact?    22                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    23                 THE WITNESS:  Yes.    24   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    25         Q.     Because if McKesson doesn't    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 5 7     Case: fr&jmtyQ^ffm&&&#^Wt?fefitte$o<%G&Mk�%$�?2a8?@m$t�$&fo.ew    1      follow  the   law,   then  diversion   is   likely.    2      You agree  with  that   statement?    3                                        MS.   HENN:      Objection  to   form.    4                                        THE   WITNESS:      I   don't   know   if    5                I'd  say   --   always  characterize   it  as    6                likely  all   the   time,   but   diversion  can    7         happen.    8   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    9         Q.     Okay.  Well, in this specific    10   provision, the United States Congress passed    11   a law to close the system of distribution and    12   enact laws to reduce the widespread diversion    13   of these drugs.  You agree with that?  That's    14   the purpose of this law?    15                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    16                 THE WITNESS:  Yes.    17   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    18         Q.     So the idea here is that --to    19   close the system of distribution so that we    20   keep these dangerous opium pills inside the    21   legitimate market for medical care, agreed?    22         a.     Agreed.    23          Q.     And that's why we have these    24   laws enacted, so that we can do our best to    25   keep these drugs to the patients that need    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 5 8     Case: k&j^<^4m&&Q&#^WiJfefitte$o0?(^^#Q^i^?der^�Sft^f^lew    1   them, agreed?    2   A.     Agreed.    3   Q.     And if you don't follow those    4   laws, then what happens is we have diversion    5   into the illicit market?    6   MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    7   THE WITNESS:  That can happen    8   if you don't follow those laws.    9   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    10   Q.     And that's the reason Congress    11   created the laws as stated in this finding?    12   MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    13   THE WITNESS:  Correct.    14   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    15   Q.     Next I'm going to have you flip    16   to page 11.  And I just highlighted one    17   sentence in here.  And it says, ""The price    18   for participation in this traffic,"" which is    19   illicit drug trafficking, ""should be    20   prohibitive.""    21   Do you see that sentence?    22   A.     I see that.    23   Q.     Does McKesson acknowledge that?    24   MS.

FARRELL:    7         Q.     It just makes sense, right?  If    8   you're going to punish somebody and the    9   punishment isn't very severe, they're likely    10   to what?    11                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    12                 THE WITNESS:  To do it again.    13   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    14         Q.     Why?    15         A.     There's no penalty or    16   accountability.    17         Q.     And so by making the penalty    18   prohibitive, what does it do?    19                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    20                 THE WITNESS:  Could you ask the    21         question in a -- again?  What --    22   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    23          Q.     if you make the penalty    24   prohibitive, then what happens?    25                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.

HENN:  And just to note for    5          everyone's knowledge, many of you know    6          this, but in the deposition protocol,    7         one defendant's objection counts for    8          all defendants, so there's no need to    9         do depositions {sic} if I'm done them.    10         But if on the phone you can't hear me,    11          I can try to speak up.    12                 MR.

Yeah, could you put it in    22   simpler terms in --    23          Q.     Yeah.  Let me put it --    24         a.     Just so I know.    25         Q.     --in other terms.

HENN:  Objection to form.    6   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    7         Q.            What would happen?    8         A.            It wouldn't hold the same    9   weight or it wouldn't -- it may not deter    10   people from speeding.    11         Q.            What if the speeding ticket was    12   a million dollars?  What would that do?    13                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    14                 THE WITNESS:  I'm just    15         guessing, but likely people would not    16          speed.    17   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    18         Q.            Because the penalty would be    19   prohibitive, agreed? 2 0                     a.     Agreed.    21         Q.            Like not to be cute, but    22   McKesson was fined $13 million in 2008 and    23   then was fined again in 2017 $150 million.    24                 Do you think that the second    25   fine was intended to be more prohibitive than    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 62     Case: ^tn^^S^^^^m.#^Wi^^^b ^G&Mk�/k$�?2a8?@m$t��&iew    1   the first fine?    2                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    3                 THE WITNESS:  I believe so.    4   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    5         Q.     All right.  Now, let's go to    6   Bates stamp page 26.    7                 And it says, ""Titles 2 and 3 of    8   the bill deal with law enforcement aspect of    9   drug abuse and provide authority for the    10   Department of Justice to keep track of all    11   drugs subject to abuse, manufactured or    12   distributed in the United States, in order to    13   prevent diversion of these drugs from    14   legitimate channels of commerce.""    15                 Does McKesson acknowledge the    16   truth of that statement?    17                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    18                 THE WITNESS:  Yes.    19   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    20         Q.     This is just another reflection    21   of the US Code that we were reading that    22   Congress is giving the authority to the    23   Department of Justice to enact safety rules    24   in order to prevent the diversion of    25   controlled substances, including opium pills,    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 63     Case: fr&jmtyQ2�&$m&&&#^Wt?fefitte$o^G&Mk�5&�?2a8?@m$t�mPiew    1     from legitimate  channels   into   illegitimate    2   channels.    3                 Does McKesson acknowledge that?    4                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    5                 THE WITNESS:  Yes.    6   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    7         Q.     Flip to page 27, the very next    8   page.    9                 It says, ""The legislation    10   provides that all persons engaged in a    11   legitimate distribution chain involving drugs    12   included in one of the schedules under the    13   bill must be registered with the Attorney    14   General.""    15                 So again, this is bringing full    16   circle the authority of the Attorney General    17   and the Department of Justice to promulgate    18   rules for those that wish to engage in the    19   closed system of distribution for controlled    20   substances, and McKesson acknowledges that?    21                 MS.

Does McKesson acknowledge the    9   truth of that statement?    10         a.     Yes.    11         Q.     So if somebody in the chain of    12   distribution breaks the law, it has a    13   substantial detrimental effect on the public    14   health and general welfare, agreed?    15                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    16                 THE WITNESS:  It can.    17   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    18         Q.     Now go to page 44.    19                 Again, this is another    20   reiteration that Congress authorizes the    21   Attorney General to ""promulgate rules and    22   regulations and to charge reasonable fees    23   relating to the registration and control of    24   the manufacture, distribution and dispensing    25   of substances covered by the Act.""

Now flip to page 45, the very    8   next one.  This is a little bit longer, so    9   I'm going to give you a chance to read it    10   real quick.    11         A.     Okay.  I've read it.    12         Q.     So I'm going to read it aloud,    13   and I'm going to stop and ask you some    14   questions.    15                 It's -- Section B of    16   Section 303 states that the Attorney General,    17   when issuing registrations, is going to    18   consider several factors, agreed?    19         A.     Can you say that again?  I was    20   looking at --    21         Q.     Yeah, I was trying to summarize    22   the first four lines.    23         a.     Yeah.    24         Q.     Basically, what it really boils    25   down to is this is a reiteration of the    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 66     Case: fr&jmty <&�G#m&&&#^Wt?fefitte$o <%G&Mk�*&�?2a8?@m$t�m?iew    1       findings  behind  the   statute   that   I   showed you    2       regarding  maintaining  effective   control.    3                                   So   if  you  drop  down  to  where   it    4       says  number  1   at  the bottom of   the  page   --    5       can you  start   reading  there?    6                       A.            Yeah.     Okay.    7          Q.     Will you read that aloud,    8   please, starting with ""maintenance of    9   effective controls""?    10          a.     ""Maintenance of effective    11   controls against diversion of particular    12   controlled substances into other than    13   legitimate medical, scientific and industrial    14   channels.""    15          Q.     All right.  So again, what    16   we're talking about is the enactment of rules    17   to prevent diversion?    18          A.     Correct.    19          Q.     Last factor, factor 5, would 2 0       you read that?    21          A.     ""Such other factors as may be    22   relevant to and consistent with the public    23   health and safety.""    24          Q.     Does McKesson acknowledge that    25   Congress gave the Department of Justice the    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 67     Case: fr&jmty Q^fm&&m.*-1W�>^�i\e�o O^^^j??rderi^f?aHrt^�^ew    1   authority to promulgate rules which govern    2   McKesson so that they maintain effective    3   controls against diversion, and to adopt any    4   other rule they want that may be relevant and    5   consistent with public health and safety?    6                 MS.

I just want to make sure that    10   we start off with the premise that the rules    11   we're about to go through aren't designed    12   to -- let me ask it in a better way.    13                 The rules that we're about to    14   get into, McKesson acknowledges, are designed    15   with the primary purpose of preventing    16   diversion?    17                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    18                 THE WITNESS:  Correct.    19   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    20         Q.     Because diversion impacts    21   public health and safety, and McKesson    22   acknowledges that?    23         a.     Yes.    24                                        MS.

The next exhibit we'll have is    4   marked as Exhibit 7, and correspondingly in    5   the top right-hand corner it's MCK    6   30(b)(6)_07-01, and it's just one page.    7                 Once we get through this    8   section, we can take a break if you like.    9                 All right.  So what I'm going    10   to represent to you is that you will not find    11   this anywhere on the Internet either because    12   I made it.  In the top left-hand corner is    13   the Department of Justice seal, and in the    14   top right-hand corner is the Drug Enforcement    15   Administration seal, and in the middle is    16   where you can trace down the rules that    17   govern McKesson.    18                 Does McKesson acknowledge that    19   Title 21 CFR 1301.74 governs its conduct with    20   the distribution of controlled substances,    21   including opium pills?    22                 MS.

Part B is what we're going to    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 6 9     Case: k&j^<^4m&&Q&#^W^&te$o^G&MkJl<$�?2a8?@m$t�mfc.ew    1   spend the   rest of the day on.     2         Have you read part B before?    3   A.

FARRELL:    6         Q.     And so bringing full circle, we    7   understand that the purpose of this    8   regulation, one of them, is the prevention of    9   diversion, correct?    10                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    11                 THE WITNESS:  Correct.    12   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    13          Q.     So if you engage in illegal    14   conduct and violate paragraph B, the result    15   of that is diversion?    16                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    17   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    18         Q.     It's the whole reason this law    19   was enacted?    20                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    21   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    22         Q.     Does McKesson acknowledge that?    23         a.     Could you ask the specific    24   question again?    25                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.

Yeah, it got very complicated    3   because it was a compound question with    4   compound objections.    5                 Does McKesson acknowledge that    6   paragraph B that we're looking at here is    7   intended to prevent diversion?    8                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    9                 THE WITNESS:  Yes.    10   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    11         Q.     And that if you follow --if    12   McKesson abides by paragraph B, its conduct    13   is legal and diversion is prevented?    14                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    15                 THE WITNESS:  Agreed.    16   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    17         Q.     And if McKesson does not abide    18   by paragraph B, its conduct is illegal and    19   the result could be diversion?    20                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    21                 THE WITNESS:  Agree.  The    22          result could be diversion.    23   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    24         Q.     Well, if McKesson is    25   distributing orders of unusual size, could it    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 72     Case: k&j^<^4m&&Q&#^W^&te$o 0?(^^^i#2der^�iftft^S^ew    1   be anything other than diversion?    2                 MS.

HENN:  Objection to form.    8                 THE WITNESS:  Maybe the best --    9         a customer adds, you know -- their    10         business model changes or they add --    11          for example, a pharmacy may add    12          contracts with multiple long-term care    13          facilities and require that they now    14          dispense more for legitimate reasons,    15          so they could order more in that    16          context.    17   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    18         Q.     So what's the purpose of the    19   Department of Justice making McKesson follow 2 0       paragraph B?    21                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    22                 THE WITNESS:  Say that again?    23                 What's the purpose of why we    24          follow that?

I forgot to warn you before the    6   break, but during the break, did you have any    7   meaningful conversations with your counsel    8   about your testimony?    9                 MS.

HENN:  And I'm just going    18          to instruct the witness not to divulge    19         what we talked about.  I don't think    20          that's an appropriate question.  I    21          think you got the answer you were    22          looking for.    23                 MR.

HENN:  And I'll instruct    6          the witness not to divulge particulars    7         of what we talked about.    8                 But you may answer that    9         question yes or no.    10                 THE WITNESS:  Yes.    11   QUESTIONS BY MR.

HENN:  I'm going to    14          instruct the witness not to answer    15          that question as calling for    16         privileged information.    17                 MR. FARRELL:  Right.  But the    18          deposition protocol and the rules    19         governing this litigation state that    20          counsel is not allowed to discuss with    21          the witness the substance of any    22          testimony during a break.    23                 And so his answer in the    24          affirmative indicates that that    25         occurred, and so I should be allowed    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 8 0     Case: fr�\3m$-cmtM&&m*-1Wb^�i\e�o ^{&&&�2<$�?2a8?@m$t�m7iew    1          to inquire about that.    2                 MS.

Well,    3          let's take a break, and we will    4          discuss outside and have a privileged    5          conversation, and we'll see if there's    6          any answer that he can provide without    7         divulging privileged information that    8          I don't believe you're entitled to.    9                 MR.

HENN:  No, Counsel, that's    14         not what's going to happen.  But I'd    15          like to take a break so that I can    16          talk to my witness about answering the    17         question inquiring into discussions    18         with counsel.    19                 MR.

And back then there    6   was a big debate on whether or not this was    7   something the federal government can do or    8   it's something that should be left to the    9   states.    10                 So what the federal government    11   decided to do was pass the Harrison Narcotic    12   Act.  What that did was it basically taxed    13   opium as a way for the federal government to    14   control, and this is a debate about the    15   taxation on the importation of opium.    16         A.     Okay.    17         Q.     Page 72 is the beginning of the    18   testimony of Mr. McKesson from McKesson &    19   Robbins, which is the predecessor and when    20   McKesson Corporation was in the private hands    21   of the McKesson family.    22                 You acknowledge that?    23         A.     Correct.    24         Q.     I'm going to have you flip to    25   page 75.  And if you look near the top, one    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 8 8     Case: k&j^<^4m&&Q&#^W^&te$o ^(SS&S^QSli??rder^saHfty2^5iew    1   of congressmen asks Mr. McKesson about     2   whether or not he supports this bill.  And     3   I'm going to give you an opportunity to read     4   to yourself   the provision before I ask you to    5   read it aloud.     6   A.   Which specific part do you want    7   me to start   and end at?    8   Q.   The first time it says    9   ""Mr. McKesson.""     10   A.   Okay.    11   Q.   He's asked about whether or not    12   he's in favor of the bill.     13      Do you see that?    14   A.   I do.    15   Q.   And his answer is, ""Yes, very    16   much in favor of the bill.""     17      Do you see that provision?    18   A.   I do.    19   Q.   Now, would you please begin    20   reading the   next sentence?    21   A.   Out loud?    22   Q.   Please.    23   A.   ""Our firm was founded in 1832,    24   and we have   been ever since against the sale    25   of habit-forming drugs and all that kind of     Golkow Litigation Services    Page 8 9     Case: k&j^<^4m&&Q&#^W^&te$o ^{&&&$l<$�?2a8?@m$t�mfc.ew    1       thing.

So you agree  with me  that   even    6       before  the  enactment  of  the  Controlled    7       Substances  Act  and  the  Code  of   Federal    8       Regulations,   which we  discussed earlier  this    9       morning,   is  that  McKesson,   Mr.   McKesson    10       hisself,   was  acknowledging  that   if   they have    11       suspicious  people,   they're  going  to  turn   it    12       over  to   law  enforcement   for prosecution,    13   agreed?    14                 MS.

And this duty predates the US    19   Code and predates the Code of Federal    20   Regulations, agreed?    21                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    22                 THE WITNESS:  Agreed.    23   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    24         Q.     So would you agree, would    25   McKesson agree, that it owes a common law    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 9 0     Case: k&j^<^4m&&Q&#^W^&te$o^G&Mk$2<$�?2a8?@m$t�m7iew    1   duty to the American public to prevent    2   diversion if it's engaged in the distribution    3   of controlled substances, including opium    4   pills, to prevent their diversion into the    5   illicit market?    6                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    7                 THE WITNESS:  Can you ask it in    8          a shorter version there?    9   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    10         Q.     Probably not.    11                 Does McKesson acknowledge it    12   owes a common law duty to the American public    13   to prevent the diversion of controlled    14   substances, including opium pills, into the    15   illicit market?    16                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    17                 THE WITNESS:  Yes.    18   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    19         Q.     Now, the first part of the    20   sentence, it kind of grabbed my attention.    21   It says, ""McKesson has ever since been    22   against the sale of habit-forming drugs.""    23   And this was in 1910.    24                 Do you see that?    25         a.     I see that.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 91     Case: k&j^<^4m&&Q&#^W^&te$o ^{&&&$3&�?2a8?@m$t�m&.ew    1         Q.

FARRELL:    6         Q.     At some point in time    7   McKesson's philosophy changed, and it went    8   from not selling habit-forming drugs to now    9   selling habit-forming drugs, agreed?    10                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    11                 THE WITNESS:  Agreed.    12   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    13          Q.     Has McKesson considered, given    14   the presence of the opioid epidemic in    15   America, perhaps returning to the stance of    16   1910 of its founder, Mr. McKesson?    17                 MS.

FARRELL:    22         Q.     Well, you could choose not to    23   sell opium pills anymore in America, could    24   you not?    25         a.     You could choose to.

But McKesson chooses to    2   continue to sell opium pills in America,    3   despite the fact that we have an opiate pill    4   epidemic?    5                 MS.

In the top    12   right-hand corner, this is 1996, 04, 01.    13                 We've acknowledged that in    14   1971, Department of Justice adopted CFR    15   provision 1301.74, agreed?    16         a.     Agree.    17         Q.     And then we went through and    18   it's the law today, agreed?    19         a.     Agreed.    20         Q.     It's the law that was    21   referenced in the Masters Pharmaceutical    22   case, agreed?    23         a.     Agreed.    24         Q.

This is a specific year.    6   Can you tell me what year it    7   is?    8   A.     1996.    9   Q.     Why do you think I picked this    10   year?    11   MS.

What happened in 1996 that    16   changed the face of opioid sales in America?    17   MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    18   THE WITNESS:  I'm not    19   100 percent sure.

In 1996, I'll represent to you,    13   OxyContin   was launched.  So all I'm trying to    14   establish   on page 2 of the exhibit is that    15   under 1301.74 B, the same law was in place     16   when OxyContin was launched.     17      MS.

So you don't have any basis in    12   fact, as the McKesson designee today, to    13   discuss what the policies and procedures were    14   for McKesson related to the distribution of    15   controlled substances and opium pills between    16    '96 when OxyContin was launched and the    17   adoption of Section 55, Exhibit 12, in July    18   of 2000; is that a fair statement?    19                 MS.

It's the drug operation manual.    4   It's been -- but it's known as Section 55,    5   often within McKesson, which is also in the    6   title.    7   Q.     And as of July 2000, is there    8   any other document related to the    9   distribution of controlled substances in the    10   prevention of diversion other than    11   Section 55?    12   MS.

If you're a referee, how many    5   different books do you have to read to know    6   the rules of wrestling on the mat?    7         A.     Should be one.    8         Q.     Is that the same for this    9   document, Exhibit 12?

That's the purpose of this    10   document?    11   A.     Right.    12   Q.     Who wrote this document?    13   A.     I'm not 100 percent sure    14   exactly who wrote it within the McKesson    15   team, but a combination of people.    16   Q.     Whose document is this?    17   MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    18   THE WITNESS:  McKesson's.    19   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    20   Q.

Well, not as of July 2000.    9         A.     Oh, can you say it again?    10         Q.     Yeah.  This document, sitting    11   here today --    12         A.     Right.    13          Q.     --is this a document that as    14   of July of the year 2 000 was a document    15   created by McKesson in the course of    16   conducting its regular business activities?    17                 MS.

So if I hold this document up    21   in a courtroom I can say this is McKesson's    22   drug operations manual related to the    23   distribution of controlled substances that    24   was adopted in July of 2000?    25         a.

Now, the second sentence,    2   starting with ""The Drug Enforcement    3   Administration,"" can you read that sentence    4   aloud?    5         A.     Sure.    6                 ""The Drug Enforcement    7   Administration strictly interprets the law    8   and regulations and has imposed significant    9   fines for technical errors in completing    10   forms and keeping records.""    11         Q.     So the DEA, even as of July    12   2000, took the Controlled Substances Act very    13   seriously, and McKesson acknowledges that,    14   agreed?    15                 MS.

""It's extremely important that    22   McKesson employees comply fully with the    23   regulations and the following guidelines.""    24         Q.

""All compliance training    11   sessions, formal and informal, held in your    12   distribution center must be logged and    13   documented on the DEA continuing education    14   report.""    15   Q.

I don't believe I have, no.    4   Q.   But if we ask for it, it's    5   something   McKesson could theoretically go and    6   look for?       7      MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    8   Outside the scope.     9      THE WITNESS:  Theoretically.    10   QUESTIONS   BY MR. FARRELL:    11   Q.   All right.  Because the policy    12   seems to d   .ndicate you guys have this    13   documentat   .ion of compliance training    14   sessions.   And I'll admit to you I haven't    15   seen any,   so I was wondering if you'd seen    16   any.       17   A.   I have not.    18   Q.   Now, if you flip to the next    19   page, page   ; 28, at the top it's paragraph A.    20   And will you read the title of paragraph A?     21   A.   ""Detecting suspicious orders.""    22   Q.

And then under    3   paragraph   1, you see where it says, ""DEA    4   regulation defines suspicious orders as     5   follows""?       6   A.   I do.    7   Q.   Will you read what's in the    8   quotation   marks?    9   A.   ""Suspicious orders include    10   orders of   unusual size, orders deviating    11   substantially from a normal pattern and     12   orders of   unusual frequency.""    13   Q.   Now, if you go down to the    14   paragraph   that starts ""recent cases,"" do you    15   see that?       16      Will you read the first    17   sentence?       18   A.   ""Recent cases indicate that DEA    19   will seek   large penalties from distributors    20   who fail to comply with this regulation.""     21   Q.

I don't -- I    5         don't have the context of before --    6          everything before, but it's a large    7          increase.    8   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    9         Q.     Well, assuming in 1996 there    10   were 300,000 prescriptions and five years    11   later there were 6 million, would you --    12   would you characterize that increase as    13   unusual?    14                 MS.

Now, two paragraphs down it    5   says, ""In its testimony today"" --    6                 Do you see that paragraph?    7         A.     I do.    8         Q.     -- ""Purdue Pharma will argue    9   that the death figures heralded by newspapers    10   nationwide are inaccurate and are the prime    11   mover of the negative hype surrounding    12   OxyContin.""    13                 Do you see that sentence?    14         A.     I do see that sentence.    15         Q.     So does McKesson acknowledge    16   that death figures are being heralded by    17   newspapers nationwide as of 2001?    18                 MS.

FARRELL:    23          Q.     Yeah.    24                 This is saying that there's    25   newspaper headlines across the country of    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 13 8     Case: %i?tfnfyOmfc$&&i&BS& 19�MfeE^&y%^eh*%%tel%&mL$ft$2&Z&.ew    1   people dying taking opium pills that McKesson    2   is distributing.    3                 Does McKesson acknowledge that?    4                 MS.

FARRELL:    10         Q.     In 2001?    11         A.     I don't know of any    12   specifically.  I'm assuming there were in    13   that time frame.    14         Q.     And it's a little unfair to ask    15   you because you weren't there in 2001, but as    16   McKesson's corporate designee I'm simply    17   looking for an acknowledgement that the chain    18   of distribution McKesson was involved in is    19   being heralded in newspapers as causing    20   deaths across the country.    21                 MS.

FARRELL:    7         Q.     I'm not asking you if you were    8   called out as a distributor.  What I'm asking    9   you is if McKesson acknowledged that the    10   pills that it was selling was causing deaths    11   nationwide and resulted in newspaper    12   headlines across the country.    13                 MS.

This is a report generated by    19   the OIG in 2002, and what it was talking    20   about was it was talking about the opioid    21   epidemic, and it was talking about the DEA's    22   ability to regulate the industry.    2 3                                     Have you reviewed this document    24       before today?    2 5        a.

Give me a second here.    2                 On Bates stamp page 12, it's    3   talking about diversion investigators.  And    4   it says there were 55 at headquarters and 455    5   in the domestic field offices and 13    6   overseas.    7                 Do you see that?    8         A.     I do see that.    9         Q.     So that means there's just over    10   500 DEA diversion investigators in the    11   country in 2001.    12                 MS.

The OIG report basically says    3   that as of 2001 there needed to be    4   reassessment because the DEA was understaffed    5   and underfunded and didn't have sufficient    6   tools to be able to regulate the industry.    7                 Does McKesson acknowledge and    8   agree with that assessment?    9                 MS.

But does McKesson acknowledge    18   that in 2001 there were 500 DEA diversion    19   investigators trying to monitor all of the    20   transactions in the country?    21                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    22         Outside the scope.    23                 THE WITNESS:  I see that in the    24          documents.  I can't speak to, you    25         know, the DEA's total -- their    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 144     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^eh*%%tel%&ml$ft$2&Zte.ew    1          response in total, so I can confirm    2          that's in -- what's in this document.    3   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    4         Q.     All right.  So let's talk about    5   it from a theoretical standpoint.    6                 Let's say there were 500    7   highway patrol officers charged with    8   regulating the speed on the highways in the    9   United States of America in the year 2001.    10                 Do you believe that that would    11   be a significant challenge, a somewhat of a    12   challenge or not very challengeable at all?    13                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    14         Outside the scope.    15                 THE WITNESS:  Again, just    16          speculating, it would be a challenge.    17   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    18         Q.     How many people would speed in    19   America if there were only 500 highway    20   patrolmen in the country?    21                 MS. HENN:  Same objections.    22                 THE WITNESS:  I can't even    23          guess or speculate.    24   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    25         Q.     Do you think that would be a    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 14 5     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^eh*^%tel%&ml$ft$2&ZW.ew    1       lot  of  people  or not  a  lot  of  people?    2                                     MS.   HENN:      Same  objections.    3                                     THE   WITNESS:      Again,    that    4                     depends   on  how many  law-abiding    5                     citizens  you  have.      I   don't   know   if   I    6                     can  speculate.    7        QUESTIONS   BY   MR.    FARRELL:    8                     Q.           That   is   so  true.    9                 What do you think the American    10   citizen would do if they knew there were only    11   500 highway patrolmen?    12                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    13          Outside the scope.    14                 THE WITNESS:  Again, I don't    15         know.  Some people might speed.  Some    16         people might not change their behavior    17         at all.    18   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    19         Q.     That's right.    20                 What if the penalty, if you did    21   get caught, was only $10?    22                 MS. HENN:  Objection to scope.    23   QUESTIONS BY MR.

It really    6          depends.    7   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    8         Q.     What if the biggest weapon the    9   highway patrolmen had, which is the    10   revocation of the driver's license, was    11   changed and so now you don't even lose your    12   license?  How would that impact the system?    13                 MS. HENN:  Same objections.    14                 THE WITNESS:  Impact the    15          system?    16   QUESTIONS BY MR.

So if there's -- if there's a    7   limited number of regulators and a fine is    8   not substantial and you don't lose your    9   license, are we going to have more speeders    10   or less speeders?    11                 MS.

If there's not enough law    21   enforcement and the penalty isn't    22   prohibitive, what happens to conduct?    23                 MS.

What   if  you made  billion  of    5       dollars  by  speeding,   and there  was  not   enough    6       regulation by  law  enforcement  and  the  penalty    7       was  not  very big?     What  would  that  do  as  an    8   incentive?    9                 MS. HENN:  Same objections.    10                 THE WITNESS:  Again, it depends    11         on the situation, the scenario.    12   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    13          Q.     it really depends on whether or    14   not the individual is a law-abiding citizen    15   or a criminal, agreed?    16                 MS.

I'm going to have marked    2   Exhibit 15, and the exhibit in the top    3   right-hand corner is 2004_ 06_17.  And for    4   those of you playing at home, this is an    5   excerpt from another Congressional record.    6                 This Congressional record was    7   900 pages long, and so I did not copy the    8   whole thing; I just pulled out the part that    9   interested me.    10                 This is part of the US Senate    11   Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, and    12   it was a hearing in June of 2004.  And the    13   title of the hearing was ""Buyers Beware:  The    14   Dangers of Purchasing Pharmaceuticals Over    15   the Internet.""    16                 Now, McKesson has some    17   experience with this, agreed?    18                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    19                 THE WITNESS:  Can you define --    20          experience.  What type of experience?    21   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    22         Q.     Well, McKesson was selling to    23   Internet pharmacies in this time frame,    24   agreed?    25                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 15 0     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&%%tel%&ml$ft$2&Z$lew    1                 THE WITNESS:  I believe so.    2   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    3          Q.     Well, McKesson should know so    4   because you paid a $13 million fine to the    5   DEA for doing that very thing in 2008.    6                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    7                 THE WITNESS:  Understood.    8   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    9         Q.     Okay.  So this is a report, and    10   it was -- if you flip to page 2, it was    11   generated by a company called the    12   Pharmaceutical Research Manufacturers of    13   America.  I guess they call it PhRMA.    14                 Is that how you say it?    15         A.     I don't know.    16         Q.     Well, McKesson is a member of    17   this organization, and so colloquially within    18   your ranks do you call it PhRMA?  PhRMA?    19   PhRMA?  What do you say?    20                 MS. HENN:  Counsel, I'm sorry,    21          just a quick clarification.  I'm not    22          seeing a reference -- I see reference    23          to Giuliani and his organization, but    24          i don't see PhRMA.    25                 Can you just point out where    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 151     Case: %i?$)fyOmfc$&&i&BS& 19�MfeE^&y%^e&%%tel%<&�&$ft$2&ZW.ew    1   you're seeing that?    2   MR. FARRELL:  Yeah, it's up on    3   the screen there, and it's in the very    4   middle.    5   MS. HENN:  Thank you.  I    6   appreciate that.    7   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    8   Q.     So does McKesson -- first, does    9   McKesson acknowledge that it is an associate    10   member of the Pharmaceutical Research and    11   Manufacturers of America?    12   MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    13   Outside the scope.    14   THE WITNESS:  I can't speak to    15   that.  I don't know.    16   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    17   Q.     I'll represent to you -- I'll    18   represent to you that you are.    19   A.     Okay.    20   Q.     And do you know who this Rudy    21   Giuliani fellow is?    22   A.     I do know who Mr. Giuliani is.    23   Q.     He's a lawyer, too, isn't he?    24   A.     He is.    25   Q.     And he was hired to do this    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 152     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&b%tel%&ml$ft$2&ZW.ew    1   investigation by the pharmaceutical industry.    2                 Do you see that?    3                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    4         Outside the scope.    5                 THE WITNESS:  I don't know if I    6          see where specifically it states that.    7   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    8         Q.     It says, ""Giuliani Partners has    9   been"" --    10         A.     Oh, in the middle.  Okay.    11   Sorry.    12         Q.     They have been retained by    13   PhRMA to do an evaluation.    14         A.     Understood.  I see that.    15         Q.     Now what I'm going to have you    16   do is I'm going to have you flip over to    17   page 4, and it's interesting what Rudy    18   Giuliani found.    19                 Do you see where it says ""the    20   distribution chain""?    21                 It says, ""On its face, it    22   appears that the distribution chain for    23   prescription medicines in the United States    24   is fairly straightforward.""    25         A.     I was on the wrong number 4.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 15 3     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&%%tel%<&�&$ft$2&Zyiew    1      I see where it says that.    2   Q.   And it says, ""Manufacturers    3   sell their products to wholesalers.""     4      That'd be you, McKesson,    5   correct?       6   A.   Correct.    7   Q.   ""Who, in turn, sell the    8   products   to retail pharmacies and stores,    9   who, in turn, dispense medicines to patients     10   with prescriptions.""     11      Do you see that?    12   A.   Yes.    13   Q.   And that's a straightforward    14   system is   what Rudy Giuliani is saying.    15      Will you read the next    16   sentence,   please?    17   A.   ""It is not until the system is    18   studied in greater detail that one begins to     19   appreciate both the complexities and the     20   vulnerabi   lity of the distribution chain and    21   potential   for exploitation or abuse.""    22   Q.   So big pharma is acknowledging    23   in 2004,   through hiring their own expert in    24   presenting to Congress, that this chain of     25   distribut   ion that McKesson is engaged in is    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 154     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&%%tel%&ml$ft$2&Z51ew    1       complex  and vulnerable   for  exploitation  or    2       abuse,   agreed?    3                                        MS.   HENN:      Objection  to   form.    4                    Outside  the   scope.    5                                        THE   WITNESS:      It's   what   they    6                    listed  in here  and documented,   yes.    7   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    8         Q.     And the very first factor for    9   contributing factors, will you read aloud    10   what it says?    11         A.     ""Wholesalers or distributors    12   are primarily regulated by the states, with    13   no uniform standards across state borders.    14   States have a comparatively small number of    15   investigators to monitor the licensed    16   wholesalers; thus, given the sheer number of    17   wholesalers, oversight is minimal.""    18         Q.     in the very next paragraph it    19   says, ""There are thousands of secondary    20   pharmaceutical wholesalers in addition to    21   McKesson, AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal    22   Health, the big three.""    23                 Do you see that sentence?    24         a.     I see that.    25         Q.     So this is a recognition by big    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 15 5     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e^%tel%&ml$ft$2&Zft.ew    1   pharma's own consultant that the chain of     2   distribution, at   least in 2004 with respect    3   to rogue Internet pharmacies in particular,     4   was subject to exploitation or abuse.     5   MS.   HENN:  Objection to form.    6   Outside the scope.     7   QUESTIONS BY MR.   FARRELL:    8   Q.     Agreed that's what it says?     9   MS.   HENN:  Same objections.    10   THE   WITNESS:  Agree that's what    11   it says.       12   QUESTIONS BY MR.   FARRELL:    13   Q.     And   in fact, McKesson paid a    14   fine for some of   these exploitations and    15   abuse in 2008.       16   MS.   HENN:  Objection to form.    17   QUESTIONS BY MR.   FARRELL:    18   Q.     Agreed?     19   A.     There was a fine as part of the     20   settlement.       21   Q.     Related to this specific topic?     22   MS.   HENN:  Objection to form.    23   THE   WITNESS:  It was included    24   in the settlement.     25          Golkow Litigation Services    Page 15 6     Case: %i?tfnfyOmfc$&&i&BS& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&%%tel%&mL$ft$2&Z&.ew    1   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    2         Q.     So yes?    3         A.      Yes.    4         Q.     So in 2004, we've got big    5   pharma acknowledging the chain of custody for    6   wholesalers is subject to exploitation or    7   abuse because of a lack of oversight?    8                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    9         Outside the scope.    10                 THE WITNESS:  Would you say    11          that again?  Ask --    12   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    13          Q.     In 2 0 04, big pharma hired Rudy    14   Giuliani's firm to do an evaluation of the    15   chain of distribution of prescription    16   medicines, and what he found was that the    17   chain of distribution was subject to    18   exploitation or abuse because of lack of    19   oversight?    20         a.     That's what's stated in the    21   document, correct.    22         Q.     And that during this time    23   frame, McKesson paid a fine for that very    24   thing?    25                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 15 7     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^�y%^e&*%tel%&mL$ft$2&ZVL-ew    1                 THE WITNESS:  In the 2008    2          settlement, yes.    3   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    4         Q.     And that fine was related to    5   McKesson selling an unusual size of    6   prescription opiate pills to rogue Internet    7   pharmacies?    8                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    9                 THE WITNESS:  Can you ask that    10         again, one more time?  Sorry.    11   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    12         Q.     Yeah.    13                 In this time frame, McKesson    14   ended up paying a fine to the DEA for selling    15   too many opium pills to rogue Internet    16   pharmacies in violation of federal law?    17                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    18                 THE WITNESS:  To be accurate,    19          I'd have to look at the document again    20          in terms of specific language, but it    21         was part of the settlement.    22   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    23          Q.     We'll get to that after lunch.    24         a.     Okay.    25         Q.     But you acknowledge that what    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 15 8     Case: %i?tfnfyOmfc$&&i&BS& 19�MfeE^&y%^e&%%tel%&mL$ft$2&Z&.ew    1       Rudy Giuliani   said   in  2004   came  home   to  roost    2       with McKesson  when   it  paid  a   fine   in  2008?    3                                     MS.   HENN:      Objection  to   form.    4                     Outside  the   scope.    5                                     THE   WITNESS:      I   don't   know   if   I    6                     would  characterize   it   as   coming  home    7                     to  roost,   but   they're   connected  or    8                     they're  related.    9                                     MR.   FARRELL:     Take  a break.    10                                     VIDEOGRAPHER:      The   time   is    11                     12:04   p.m.     We're  going  off   the    12          record.    13           (Off the record at 12:04 p.m.)    14                 VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is    15          1:05 p.m.  We're back on the record.    16                 (McKesson-Hartle Exhibit 16    17         marked for identification.)    18   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    19         Q.     I'm going to reference    20   Exhibit 16 which we've just had marked.  The    21   top right-hand corner is 2006_09_27,    22   Bates-stamped MCKMDL00478906.    23                 Do you recognize this document?    24         a.     I do.    25         Q.     what is it?    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 15 9     Case: %i?tfnfyOmfc$&&i&BS& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&b%tel%&ml$ft$2&Z&.ew    1                    A.           It's  a  letter  from DEA to    2       registrants   from Joe  Rannazzisi.    3                    Q.           Is   this   --   you might   need  help    4       with  counsel   a   little  bit   on  this.    5                                   I   don't   see where  this   letter    6       is  addressed to McKesson as  the  recipient;    7       however,   this   document  was  produced by    8       McKesson.     And   I'm  assuming  this   is   the   2006    9       Rannazzisi   letter  that  was   sent  to McKesson.    10                                   Is   that  your  understanding?    11                    A.           Yes.    12         Q.     So there's no question    13   September 27, 2006, McKesson received this    14   communication.    15                 Do you know whether or not    16   there was one document sent to McKesson or    17   there was a letter sent to each of your    18   distribution facilities?    19         A.     That, I do not know.    2 0                                     MR. FARRELL:  Okay.  Can I ask,    21          Counsel, do you know?    22                 MS. HENN:  I'm sorry, I don't.    23   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    24         Q.     Anyway, if in fact there is    25   another document that has a specific one,    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 16 0     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&%%tel%&ml$ft$2&Z51ew    1   you'll agree with me that all of these 2006    2   letters that were sent out, they were sent    3   out to all the registrants across the    4   country?    5   MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    6   THE WITNESS:  Yeah, that's what    7   I believe to be the case, yeah.    8   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    9   Q.     In fact, the first sentence    10   says --    11   A.     Right.    12   Q.     -- this letter is being sent to    13   every commercial entity in the United    14   States --    15   A.

Lated amongst McKesson or it was     17   discussed    or   reviewed or analyzed?    18            MS.

FARRELL:    24      Q.      Did McKesson change its conduct    25   at   all ba,   sed   upon this correspondence?    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 163     Case: %i?tfnfyOmfc$&&i&BS& 19�MfeE^&y%^e&%%tel%&mL$ft$2&ZWlew    1         A.     From what I understand in    2   talking with a former McKesson employee    3   before this deposition, this was mostly a    4   confirmation or a reiteration of the    5   regulations, which McKesson knew, and    6   highlighting things that were -- you know,    7   that the team was doing.  And it was sort of    8   a validation of some of the things that they    9   had been doing, so the red flags and things    10   like that.  So not significant changes that    11   I'm aware of.    12         Q.     Have you had an opportunity to    13   review the 2006 Rannazzisi letter in    14   preparation for today's deposition?    15         a.     Yes.    16         Q.     On behalf of McKesson    17   Corporation, are you willing to affirm,    18   acknowledge and validate all of the    19   statements Mr. Rannazzisi places in his    20   September 27, 2006 correspondence?    21                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    22         Outside the scope.    23                 THE WITNESS:  Could you be more    24          specific?  Validate every single    25          statement and...

Yeah.    3                 Paragraph C of the 3 0(b)(6)    4   notice asks for ""testimony regarding    5   McKesson's past and present interpretation,    6   compliance, agreement and/or disagreement    7   with this letter from the DEA outlining the    8   duties imposed on a distributor under federal    9   law.""    10                 So let's start with this:  Is    11   there anything in this letter that you    12   disagree with?    13                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    14                 THE WITNESS:  I don't believe    15          there's anything I would disagree    16         with.    17   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    18         Q.     is this an accurate statement    19   of the law?    20                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    21                 THE WITNESS:  I believe it is.    22   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    23          Q.     So as of September 27, 2006,    24   the DEA is advising McKesson -- not advising,    25   but referencing the fact that there was a    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 165     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^&y%^e&^%tel%&mL$ft$2&Z&.ew    1   prescription drug abuse problem in the United    2   States of America.  That's in the very first    3   paragraph.    4                 Does McKesson acknowledge that?    5         A.     Yes.    6         Q.     The next sentence says, ""As    7   each of you is undoubtedly aware, the abuse,    8   nonmedical use, of controlled prescription    9   drugs is a serious and growing health problem    10   in the country.""    11                 Does McKesson agree and    12   acknowledge that fact as of 2006?    13                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    14                 THE WITNESS:  Yes.    15   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    16         Q.     The next full paragraph says,    17   ""The Controlled Substances Act was designed    18   by Congress to combat diversion by providing    19   for a closed system of drug distribution in    20   which all legitimate handlers of controlled    21   substances must obtain a DEA registration; as    22   a condition of maintaining such registration,    23   must take reasonable steps to ensure that    24   their registration is not being utilized as a    25   source of diversion.""

HENN:      Objection  to   form.    4                                        THE WITNESS:      I  agree  with    5                that.    6   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    7         Q.     I'd like you to read the next    8   sentence aloud, please.    9         A.     Where it starts ""distributors    10   are""?    11         Q.     Yes.    12         A.     ""Distributors are, of course,    13   one of the key components of the distribution    14   chain.""    15         Q.     Keep going, please.    16         a.     You want me to read the whole    17   paragraph?  Okay.    18                 ""If the closed system is to    19   function properly as Congress envisioned,    20   distributors must be vigilant in deciding    21   whether a prospective customer can be trusted    22   to deliver controlled substances only for    23   lawful purposes.  The responsibility is    24   critical, as Congress has expressly declared    25   that the illegal distribution of controlled    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 167     Case: %i?tfnfyOmfc$&&i&BS& 19�MfeE^&y%^e&*%tel%&^$ft$2&ZW.ew    1       substances  has  a  substantial  and detrimental    2       effect  on  the  health and general  welfare  of    3       the American people.""    4                    Q.           So  again,   this   is   the  DEA    5       reiterating what  we've  discussed before:    6       that   failing  to  abide  by the  Code  of  Federal    7       Regulations  has  a  substantial   and detrimental    8       effect  on  the  health and general  welfare  of    9       the American people.    10                                   Does  McKesson  agree  and    11       acknowledge with that   fact?    12                                   MS.   HENN:      Objection  to   form.    13                                        THE   WITNESS:      Yes.    14        QUESTIONS   BY   MR.    FARRELL:    15         Q.     Go to the next page, page 2,    16   the second full paragraph.  It says,    17   ""Nonetheless, given the extent of    18   prescription drug abuse in the United States,    19   along with the potential -- along with    20   dangerous and potentially lethal consequences    21   of such abuse"" -- will you please finish that    22   sentence?    23         A.     ""Even just one distributor that    24   uses its DEA registration to facilitate    25   diversion can cause enormous harm.""    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 16 8     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&%%tel%&ml$ft$2&Z&.ew    1         Q.     Does McKesson acknowledge and    2   accept that fact?    3                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    4                 THE WITNESS:  I agree with    5          that.    6   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    7         Q.     If you go down to the third to    8   last paragraph, it says, ""In addition to    9   reporting all suspicious orders, a    10   distributor has a statutory responsibility to    11   exercise due diligence to avoid filling    12   suspicious orders that might be diverted into    13   other than legitimate medical, scientific and    14   industrial channels.""    15                 Does McKesson acknowledge and    16   accept that to be true?    17                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    18                 THE WITNESS:  Yes.    19   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    20         Q.     And then the last sentence of    21   the next paragraph says at the end, ""The    22   distributor should exercise due care in    23   confirming the legitimacy of all orders prior    24   to filing.""    25                 Do you see that sentence?    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 16 9     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&b%tel%&mL$ft$2&Z&.ew    1                 Not ""filing.""  ""Prior to    2   filling.""    3         A.     I see that sentence.    4         Q.     All right.  Since I butchered    5   that sentence, will you please read the last    6   sentence that's highlighted on the screen?    7         A.     ""The distributor should    8   exercise due care in confirming the    9   legitimacy of all orders prior to filling.""    10         Q.     Now, this is in September    11   of 2006, agreed?    12         A.     Agreed.    13          Q.     And this is a clear statement    14   from the DEA; would you agree with that?    15         a.     I would agree with that.    16         Q.     McKesson's official position is    17   that when it received communications from the    18   DEA, the DEA was clear as of 2006?    19                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    20         Also beyond the scope.    21                 THE WITNESS:  The only question    22          i would have about possibility is due    23          care, what the definition of what due    24          care means.    25    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 17 0     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^&y%^e&%%tel%&^$ft$2&Z�lew    1   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    2         Q.     Okay.  Fair.  Fair enough.    3                 If you flip to the next page,    4   there's a laundry list of due care.    5                 Do you agree on page 3 going    6   through this, the DEA was clear with McKesson    7   about the circumstances that might be    8   indicative of diversion?    9                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    10                 THE WITNESS:  I wouldn't    11          classify these -- I wouldn't call them    12          due care.  These are to be red flags,    13          indicators.    14   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    15         Q.     So in 2006, the DEA is telling    16   McKesson, you have to exercise due care prior    17   to filling an order which you deem to be    18   suspicious, agreed?    19                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    20                 THE WITNESS:  Could you ask    21          that again?  Restate that?    22   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    23          Q.     in 2006, the DEA is telling    24   McKesson, you have to exercise due care prior    25   to filling an order which you deem to be    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 171     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^&y%^e&%%tel%&mL$ft$2&ZW.ew    1   suspicious, agreed?    2         A.     That's what's in the document,    3   yes.    4         Q.     Okay.  Do you disagree with    5   that?    6         A.     That they shared that, they --    7   I don't disagree with that.    8         Q.     Yet your Section 55 policy, you    9   testified this morning, you were shipping    10   suspicious orders?    11                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    12                 THE WITNESS:  There was a    13         process by which those reports were    14          reviewed, which I would consider to be    15         part of due care in a review.    16   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    17         Q.     is there a due care file for    18   each of those?    19                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    20                 THE WITNESS:  Not that I'm    21         aware of.    22   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    23          Q.     So there's no documentation of    24   the due care of each suspicious order that    25   was shipped by McKesson in accordance with    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 172     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&b%tel%&ml$ft$2&ZW.ew    1   the July 2000 policies and procedures?    2                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    3                 THE WITNESS:  Could you restate    4          that, please?    5   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    6         Q.     Is there any documentation of    7   the due care performed by McKesson from    8   July 2000 onward pursuant to Section 55 with    9   regard to suspicious orders that were    10   shipped?    11                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    12         Outside the scope.    13                 THE WITNESS:  I can't speak to    14          the specific documentation and how it    15         was documented those reviews that were    16          conducted of those specific reports    17          that were generated.  Could have been    18          documentation on a form.    19   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    2 0        Q.     Have you seen such    21   documentation?    22                 MS.

Well, you'll agree with me that    5   Section 55 seems to indicate that there's no    6   subjective involvement regarding the    7   reporting of suspicious orders; it was a    8   statistical fact.    9   MS.

So every single order that was    4   deemed suspicious by your monitoring program    5   should have been reported to the DEA from    6   July 2000, at least through Rannazzisi's 2006    7   letter?    8                 MS.

Right.    24         Q.     if McKesson did not report    25   suspicious orders detected following the    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 17 6     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& l9�ubg?eEre*^^    1   July 2000 Section 55 policy -- let me start    2   over.

Okay.    7         Q.     --if McKesson did not report a    8   suspicious order it detected pursuant to the    9   Section 55 policy, McKesson was in violation    10   of federal law; agreed or disagree?    11                 MS.

I apologize for pausing    16         here.    17   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    18         Q.     It's an important question.    19         a.     Yeah.    20         Q.     McKesson has a statutory and    21   regulatory responsibility under federal 2 2        law --    23         A.     Right.    24         Q.     --to report suspicious orders    25   to the DEA?

McKesson, in July of 2000,    3   adopted a policy that we've been referring to    4   as Section 55 --    5   A.     Correct.    6   Q.     -- to do that very thing?    7   A.     Correct.    8   Q.     That policy states that it's    9   not a subjective determination of whether to    10   report; it's a statistical fact of whether    11   you should report?    12   MS.

And whether to report it to the    18   DEA is not a subjective determination; it's    19   mandatory if you detect a suspicious order?    20   MS.

Thank    8   you for taking the time.    9         Q.     No problem.    10                 So to start off with on this    11   exhibit, you acknowledge that there was a    12   meeting with the DEA on April 5, 2007.  It's    13   from the very first paragraph.    14         a.     Yes.    15         Q.     So at this point in time, the    16   DEA had issued an order to show cause against    17   McKesson, agreed?    18         A.     Correct.    19         Q.     I've yet to see any    20   documentation of anything that predates    21   April 25, 2007, related to this    22   investigation.    23                 Have you seen such documents?    24                 MS.

When you go to page 2 under    18   Proposed Action Plan, does this indicate to    19   you that McKesson is acknowledging that they    20   need to do better to comply with federal law?    21                 MS.

I don't believe it    12          says to halt them.    13   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    14         Q.     it does?    15         A.     In that specific language.    16         Q.     it does or does not?    17         a.     Does not.    18         Q.     Is your interpretation of    19   federal law that you're allowed to ship a    20   suspicious order without conducting due    21   diligence?    22                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    23   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    24         Q.     Maybe this explains why    25   McKesson paid a $150 million fine.

FARRELL:    3          Q.     Let's get back to it.    4                 Masters Pharmaceutical has a    5   reporting requirement and a shipping    6   requirement.  We reviewed it this morning,    7   agreed?    8         A.     Parts of it, correct.  Agreed.    9         Q.     It's premised upon a code    10   provision.  The United States Congress passed    11   a US Code provision in 1970, agreed?    12         a.     Agreed.    13          Q.     And it passed -- the Department    14   of Justice enacted regulations which are    15   binding as federal law related to this very    16   topic, agreed?    17         a.     Agreed.    18         Q.     And if you don't follow those    19   rules, McKesson can be fined by the federal 2 0       government?    21         A.     Agreed.    22         Q.     McKesson's been fined twice    23   that I know of, once for 13 million in 2008    24   and once for 150 million in 2017, for    25   violating these very laws.

So my question to you is:  Is    6   that the shipping requirement that you have    7   to halt a suspicious order under federal law    8   until you do due diligence is and always has    9   been the law in the United States of America?    10                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    11         Outside the scope.    12                 THE WITNESS:  Can you ask that    13          again, please?    14   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    15         Q.     The shipping requirement and    16   the reporting requirement as outlined in the    17   Masters Pharmaceutical case is and always has    18   been the law in the United States of America?    19                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    20         Outside the scope.    21                 THE WITNESS:  I believe that's    22          the law.  I mean...    23   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    24         Q.     Well, you're McKesson --    25                 MS.

So your answer is yes?    8                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    9                 THE WITNESS:  Yes.    10   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    11         Q.     I don't want to -- I don't want    12   you to hesitate.    13         a.     I'm not a legal expert.    14         Q.     I'm not asking you to be a    15   legal expert.    16         A.     Right.    17         Q.     I'm asking McKesson    18   Corporation -- I know this -- to be fair, I    19   understand you are in a role with McKesson    20   being asked to step in the shoes of a    21   corporation and answer on its behalf.    22         a.     Right.    23          Q.     So I'm not trying to be rude,    24   and I know I'm pressing you.    25         A.     Right.

But  what   I'm  trying  to  do   is,    2       for  the  record,   create  McKesson's  position.    3       And  I've  asked  for McKesson  to  designate    4       someone   to  announce   its  position,   and    5       fortunately  it's  you.    6                                   So  let  me  repeat   the  question.    7       The   shipping  requirement   and  the   reporting    8       requirement   as   outlined  and  defined  in  the    9       Masters   Pharmaceutical   case   is  and always  has    10       been  the  law  in  the United  States  of America;    11       agree  or disagree?    12                                   MS.   HENN:      Object   to   the   form    13                    of  the  question.      It's  outside  the    14          scope.    15                 THE WITNESS:  I agree that    16          that's the law.    17   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    18         Q.     And if you don't follow the    19   law, that makes it unlawful?    20                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    21                 THE WITNESS:  If you don't    22          follow a law, that would be unlawful.    23   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    24         Q.     And if you don't follow the    25   shipping requirement, that's unlawful?

And if you don't follow the    6   reporting requirement, that's the law?    7                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    8                 THE WITNESS:  Again, if you    9         don't follow the law, if you don't    10          follow the guidelines, it would be    11         unlawful.    12   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    13          Q.     So when you look at paragraph 7    14   of Exhibit 17, the 2007 correspondence from    15   McKesson to the DEA, you are announcing that    16   you're going to adopt new measures,    17   additional measures, revised, amended,    18   changed, more measures, to comply with    19   federal law?    20                 MS.

Now, this letter is addressed    12   to Linden Barber.    13   Do you know who Linden Barber    14   is?    15   A.     I've heard of Linden Barber.    16   Q.     How have you heard of him?    17   A.     Just in my past experience even    18   prior to McKesson, knowing he was in DEA.    19   Q.     Do you know where he is now?    20   A.     He's at Cardinal.    21   Q.     Cardinal Health?    22   How come you-all didn't hire    23   him?    24   A.     I can't speak to that.  I don't    25   know.

I mean,    22   it's -- if it's -- it wouldn't be lawful.    23          Q.     That makes it...    24         a.     If there weren't documentation.    25   Or due diligence, excuse me.

HENN:  Objection to form.    4                 THE WITNESS:  It would be    5         unlawful.    6   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    7         Q.     So it's summarizing altogether.    8   If in May of 2007 McKesson is shipping to a    9   pharmacy in Cuyahoga or Summit County,    10   Cleveland, Ohio, or Akron, Ohio, more than    11   8,000 pills of hydrocodone or more than 8,000    12   pills of oxycodone, without conducting a due    13   diligence review, then McKesson is engaging    14   in unlawful conduct according to federal law,    15   agreed?    16                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    17                 THE WITNESS:  Can you ask it    18          again?  I apologize.  Let's pause    19         here.  I'm not a lawyer. 2 0       QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    21         Q.     I know you're not.  And again,    22   I'm going to reiterate --    23         A.     There's discretion in how this    24   due diligence is done and documented, so I'm    25   trying to understand.

So let me see if I can say it again.    3                 If in May of 2007 McKesson    4   Corporation is shipping to a pharmacy in    5   Cuyahoga or Summit County, Cleveland, Ohio,    6   or Akron, Ohio, more than 8,000 pills of    7   oxycodone or more than 8,000 pills of    8   hydrocodone without conducting due diligence,    9   then McKesson Corporation is engaging in    10   unlawful conduct according to federal law?    11                 MS. HENN:  Object to form.    12                 THE WITNESS:  I don't know how    13          to answer that exactly.  It depends.    14   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    15         Q.     Depends on what?    16                 If you ship more than 8,000    17   pills without conducting due diligence,    18   McKesson is engaging in unlawful conduct    19   according to federal law?    20                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    21                 Go ahead.    22                 THE WITNESS:  It can be    23          interpreted that way.  I mean, it --    24   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    25         Q.     Well, the DEA certainly    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 213     Case: %i?$)fyOmfc$&&i&BS& 19�MfeE^&y%^e&%%tel%&mL$ft$2&%Vlew    1   interprets it that way, agreed?    2   A.     They have.    3   Q.     And McKesson has paid fines    4   based on that DEA interpretation, agreed?    5   MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    6   THE WITNESS:  We've paid fines.    7   Again, we're --    8   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    9   Q.     Based on the allegations by the    10   DEA that you shipped suspicious orders    11   without conducting due diligence?    12   MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    13   Go ahead.    14   THE WITNESS:  Based on those    15   allegations.    16   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    17   Q.      Yes.    18   A.     Right.    19   Q.     The answer is yes?    20   A.     Yes.    21   Q.     See, a yes just gets me moving    22   faster.  Oh, this one's gonna be fun.    23   MR.

It's produced in the MDL by the    10   McKesson 1   awyers?    11   A.   Yes.    12   Q.   From the McKesson files?    13   A.   Yes.    14   Q.

So this national operations    23   conference   2007, this is a conference that is    24   just for McKesson employees.  Is that your     25   understand   ing?    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 216     Case: %i?tfnfyOmfc$&&i&BS& 19�MfeE^&y%^e&%%tel%&mL$ft$2&%&ew    1         A.     Yeah, they typically are.    2         Q.     It's from -- Mr. Boggs    3   testified about it previously.  So this was    4   in 2007.  Management basically gets together,    5   and Don Walker is the senior vice president    6   of distribution operations, is giving a    7   presentation on a number of topics in the    8   form of a PowerPoint slide?    9         A.     Correct.    10                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    11   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    12         Q.      Yes?    13         A.     Correct.    14         Q.     So the title of this is    15   ""Lifestyle Drugs and Internet Pharmacies.""    16                 ""Lifestyle drugs"" is an    17   interesting choice of words.    18                 Do you know where it came from?    19         A.     It's my understanding that's    20   the language that was -- the DEA used as well    21   and had referenced.    22         Q.     Some of the files that I've    23   seen has the DEA asking McKesson where you    24   came up with the oxycodone, hydrocodone and    25   opium pills as lifestyle drugs.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 217     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^eP-*%tel%&^$ft$2&%W.ew    1                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    2                 THE WITNESS:  All I can tell    3         you is I -- what I've heard is that    4          it's the term that came from DEA.    5   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    6         Q.     On page 2, it identifies    7   several different topics:  public health    8   issue, DEA focus, McKesson involvement,    9   current status, and Lifestyle Drug Monitoring    10   Program.  So these will be our jeopardy    11   questions today.    12                 Public health issues.  Can you    13   read what the very -- on page 3, can you read    14   what the first item is?    15         A.     ""Abuse of prescription drugs    16   has risen 66  percent since 2000.""    17         Q.     So this is McKesson telling    18   McKesson employees that we're in the business    19   of selling opium pills, and abuse has risen    20   66 percent since 2000.    21                 Does that not give you,    22   Mr. McKesson Corporation, pause to think    23   about whether or not your role in the chain    24   of distribution is contributing to the abuse?    25                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.

FARRELL:    4         Q.     This is McKesson telling    5   McKesson employees that abuse of prescription    6   drugs has risen 66   percent since the year    7   2000.    8                 Does that not give you,    9   Mr. McKesson Corporation, pause to think    10   about whether or not your role in the chain    11   of distribution is contributing to such    12   abuse?    13                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    14                 THE WITNESS:  I think it's --    15          it should give everybody pause that    16          that was the trend that was going on,    17         and it's a piece of information shared    18         with leaders to inform them.  So --    19   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    20         Q.     But not everybody is selling    21   opium pills; McKesson is.    22                 MS. HENN:  Counsel, can we just    23         make sure we let the witness finish    24         his answers?    25                 MR. FARRELL:  Sure.

HENN:  Thank you.    3   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    4         Q.     Not everyone is engaged in the    5   chain of distribution of opium pills, though?    6                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    7                 THE WITNESS:  Agree.    8   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    9         Q.     So I'm asking you, McKesson    10   Corporation, whether or not you have any    11   regrets about selling so many opium pills.    12                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    13          Outside the scope.    14                 THE WITNESS:  Back to your    15         question about this, I would -- sure    16          that gives you pause, I mean, to    17         understand that there's an epidemic    18          out there.  And clearly there's many    19         players involved in the flow of    20         distribution.    21   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    22         Q.     As of 2007, McKesson is    23   recognizing that opioid painkillers kill more    24   than cocaine and heroin combined, agreed?    25                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.

FARRELL:    3          Q.     And these are McKesson's words.    4                 Where is McKesson getting this    5   data from?    6                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    7         Outside the scope.    8                 THE WITNESS:  I don't know    9          specifically where they -- their    10          source of data for that particular    11          line, but information from different    12          sources.  Could be DEA, could be CDC,    13          it could be wherever.    14   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    15         Q.     it says here, ""Rogue Internet    16   pharmacies distributing oxycodone,    17   hydrocodone, phentermine and alprazolam,"" yet    18   McKesson was selling to rogue Internet    19   pharmacies, true?    20                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    21         Outside the scope.    22                 THE WITNESS:  Can you ask that    23          again, please?    24   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    25         Q.     McKesson is noting that rogue    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 221     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&%%tel%&ml$ft$2&%1&ew    1   Internet pharmacies are selling oxycodone and    2   hydrocodone, yet what's missing from this    3   slide is the fact that McKesson was supplying    4   the pills to the rogue Internet pharmacies.    5                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    6                 THE WITNESS:  And what's your    7          specific question again?    8   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    9         Q.     What gives?    10                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    11                 THE WITNESS:  I don't know what    12          type of response a ""what gives""    13          question is.    14   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    15         Q.     Yeah.  You're noting that    16   people are dying, and part of the reason is    17   that rogue Internet pharmacies are out there.    18   Yet McKesson, during this time frame, is    19   selling to some of those very same Internet    20   pharmacies, and that's what the DEA fined you    21   for.    22                 So is this ignorance of who    23   you're selling to?  Is this repackaging,    24   reframing the issue?  Or is it just flat out    25   a misrepresentation?

The next page, page 4,    6   ""Internet pharmacies.""

""Cutting supply critical to    12   success.""    13                 What does that mean?    14         a.     I don't know.

Do you know what price    19   diversion is?    20         a.     Not specifically.    21         Q.     Was McKesson at this time    22   considering that some of the Internet    23   pharmacies were competing with McKesson for    24   business?    25                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.

FARRELL:    17         Q.     So McKesson is writing a slide    18   following a meeting with the DEA, reporting    19   to the DEA employees what the DEA's focus    20   was, and what McKesson is reporting is that    21   the DEA expects you to know your customers.    22                 is that fair?    23         a.

This    2   is the December 27, 2007 Rannazzisi letter.    3   Do you recognize this document?    4   A.     I do.    5   Q.     McKesson Corporation    6   acknowledges receipt of this communication    7   from the DEA dated December 27, 2007,    8   correct?    9   MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    10   THE WITNESS:  Yes, we received    11   it.    12   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    13   Q.     This is a true and authentic    14   version of the McKesson letter?    15   A.     I believe so.    16   Q.     And you kept it in the routine    17   business of collecting records,    18   record-keeping at McKesson?    19   A.     I can't speak to where this was    20   stored and -- I don't know, but --    21   Q.     But it came from McKesson; it's    22   got your Bates stamp on it?    23   A.     I may be a little confused on    24   your question.    25   Q.

It  came us.    2         Q.     You're just acknowledging you    3   received this letter?    4         A.     Correct.    5         Q.     All right.  We can walk through    6   this entire letter, but I'm going to first    7   start broadly.    8                 Does McKesson acknowledge that    9   the facts and guidelines set forth in the    10   2007 Rannazzisi letter are true and an    11   accurate representation of the obligations    12   McKesson has under federal law?    13                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    14                 THE WITNESS:  Can you ask that    15         question again?    16   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    17         Q.     Yeah.    18                 This is the second time the DEA    19   is writing a dear registrant letter to 2 0       everybody in the country.    21         A.     Understood.    22         Q.     Basically what it's saying is,    23   you people still aren't getting it; here's    24   what your obligations are under federal law.    25                 And it includes the duty to    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 24 8     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&%%iM%&ml$ft$2&%ffi.ew    1       halt   suspicious  orders,   perform due  diligence    2       and report  when necessary  to  the  DEA,   agreed?    3                                     MS.

HENN:      Objection  to   form.    7                                     THE WITNESS:      It's  the  same    8                     information  they've   shared before,    9                     with  some  additions.    10        QUESTIONS   BY   MR.    FARRELL:    11         Q.     And it's clear, you have a duty    12   to halt suspicious orders, perform due    13   diligence and report when necessary.    14                 This is an affirmation a decade    15   preceding the shipping requirement and the    16   reporting requirement in the Masters    17   Pharmaceutical case, agreed?    18                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    19                 THE WITNESS:  You rolled a    20          couple things in there together.  Can    21         you ask me -- what's the specific    22          question?    23   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    24         Q.     This is a 2007 letter, which    25   predates the Masters Pharmaceutical case by a    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 24 9     Case: ki?fmfyOmfc$&&i&BS& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&b%iM%&ml$ft$2&%ffi.ew    1       decade.     And  I'm asking you whether  or  not    2     you agree  that   this   letter  sets   forth  the    3      shipping  requirements   and  the   reporting    4     requirements  as  outlined  in Masters    5   Pharmaceutical.    6                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    7                 THE WITNESS:  I'm going to read    8          this again just so --    9   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    10         Q.     Sure.    11                 The second to the last    12   paragraph is probably the most helpful.    13         a.     What's that?    14         Q.     The second to last paragraph    15   may be the most helpful.    16         A.     On the very last -- okay.    17   Before I get there --    18         Q.     it states, ""Lastly, registrants    19   that routinely report suspicious orders, yet    20   fill these orders without first determining    21   that order is not being diverted, may be    22   failing to maintain effective controls    23   against diversion.""    24                 It's what you and I have been    25   talking about for the last two hours,    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 25 0     Case: ki?fmfyOmfc$&&i&BS& 19�MfeE^�y%^e&%%iM%&mL$ft$2&%$lew    1   correct?    2         A.     Correct.    3          Q.     This is an accurate statement    4   of federal law from the DEA to McKesson,    5   agreed?    6                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    7                 THE WITNESS:  Agreed.    8   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    9         Q.     This is the same thing the DC    10   Circuit Court of Appeals said in 2017,    11   agreed?    12                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    13                 THE WITNESS:  Agreed.    14   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    15         Q.     I don't need to put this in    16   there.  But backing up to the last exhibit we    17   had from February of 2008, can you pull that    18   up?    19                 MS. HENN:  You talking about    20         Exhibit 21?    21                 MR. FARRELL:  Yes.    22   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    23          Q.     I'm going to represent to you    24   that the way that we pull these documents up    25   on the electronic system is you can pull it    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 251     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&%%iM%&ml$ft$2&m.ew    1     up   in  a   --   basically  a  photocopy version  like    2     you're   seeing  here,   but   there's   also  a  native    3      format,   which   is   actually  the   PowerPoint.    4                       A.            Okay.    5         Q.     And so what I'm showing you on    6   the screen is the same exact document, and    7   the only reason I produced it in native    8   format is that at the very bottom of each of    9   the pages, except for the first one, there's    10   a date.    11                 MR. FARRELL:  So if you flip to    12          the next page on the screen up there,    13          Corey.    14                 MS. HENN:  Do you want to just    15         hand the copy over --    16                 MR. FARRELL:  Yeah.    17                 MS. HENN:  --if that's easier?    18                 MR. FARRELL:  I just want you    19          to affirm the date on it.    2 0                                     MS. HENN:  And do you have like    21         an identifier?  I know for these kinds    22          of native documents --    2 3                                     MR. FARRELL:  Not that I can    24          figure out.  I'm not that good.    25                 MS. HENN:  All right.

What are you asking?    3   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    4   Q.     What the date is.    5   A.     On the front page?    6   Q.     On the color version, on page 2    7   maybe.    8   A.     Oh, on the bottom?  11/26 of    9   '07.  November 26, 2007.    10   (McKesson-Hartle Exhibit 24    11   marked for identification.)    12   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    13   Q.     Okay.  The next exhibit is    14   going to be Exhibit 24.  It's 2008_03_10.    15   It's another PowerPoint presentation at the    16   Denver sales meeting, March 10, 2008.    17   Have you seen this document    18   before?    19   A.     I do not believe I've seen this    20   one.    21   Q.     It has a bunch of redacted    22   stuff in here.    23   MR. FARRELL:  Counsel, do you    24   know if that was recorded in the    25   privilege log?

HENN:  I don't know off the    2          top of my head, but we can certainly    3          check.    4                 MR. FARRELL:  I think that's    5          the main reason.  It basically is    6          talking about your CSMP, the    7          three-level review, and the rollout    8         with a bunch of stuff redacted.  I    9          just wanted to put it in the record so    10         we can fool with it later.    11                 MS. HENN:  Is this a good --    12          the witness would like a break.    13                 MR. FARRELL:  Sure.    14                 MS.

And I'll acknowledge on page 2    3   the middle whereas clause that McKesson    4   denied doing anything wrong.    5                 Sitting here today, McKesson    6   continue to assert that it did nothing wrong    7   despite the fact that it paid a fine in 2008?    8                 MS.

Now, you weren't at McKesson,    20   but you're sitting here as McKesson, so    21   you're taking the position that's in the    22   document:  We didn't do anything wrong.    23                 But you acknowledge that at    24   least in 2008 the DEA -- it's beyond doubt    25   now what the DEA could possibly mean when    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 256     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�fafe^<k�y%^e&%$�l^^$ft�2&%ftev    1       they want  you  to   fulfill  your  obligations    2       under  federal   law,   agreed?    3                                   MS.

I'm trying to establish whether    11   or not McKesson Corporation believes as of    12   May 2, 2008, the DEA could be any clearer    13   about its expectations of McKesson    14   Corporation under the federal regulations    15   related to the distribution of opium pills.    16                 MS.

I can walk through all of the    20   various communications leading up to this,    21   but you'll agree with me there was a 2006    22   letter, a 2007 letter, there were    23   presentations, there were meetings, there was    24   a rule to show cause, there's a settlement    25   agreement, you got fined $13 million.

HENN:  Objection to form.    5         Outside the scope.    6                 THE WITNESS:  I agree that they    7         mentioned that in many -- in many ways    8          and many times.  There's still -- you    9         know, there are areas of the    10          regulation that are still unclear, and    11         DEA does not provide clear guidance on    12         what is an order of unusual size,    13          frequency and pattern.  They put that    14         back on the distributors to design our    15         own.    16                 So they're not -- they're clear    17         on that guidance, but not on how to do    18          it all the time.    19   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    20         Q.     All right.  So it's clear in    21   2008 what they're telling the DEA -- telling    22   McKesson is that whatever you're doing, we    23   think it's not enough?    24                 MS.

And one of the things that's    4   clear is that you have a duty to halt    5   suspicious orders and perform due diligence.    6                 Is there any reasonable person    7   in the United States of America as of 2008    8   could possibly argue that it's unclear    9   whether or not you should halt a suspicious    10   order before shipping?    11                 MS.

Well, what if somebody came up    16   and said, ""We don't know whether or not we    17   have a duty to halt before shipping a    18   suspicious order,"" what you say to them as of    19   May 2, 2008, on the heels of paying    20   $13 million to the DEA?    21                 MS.

Yes.    3                 Would you be a moron if you    4   took the position out of May 2, 2008, that    5   the DEA was unclear as to whether or not you    6   could ship a suspicious order?    7                 MS.

I'm just trying    8   to take it from a very basic standpoint.    9                 Could the DEA have made it any    10   clearer that McKesson has a duty to monitor    11   and detect suspicious orders?    12                 MS.

Do you believe there's a direct   19   correlation between the more pills that get   20   sold and the more pills that get diverted?   21                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.   22                 THE WITNESS:  Can you rephrase   23          that question?   24   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:   25         Q.      Yes.

HENN:  Objection to form.    5   THE WITNESS:  It's hard to say,    6   but you could assume that the -- you    7   know --    8   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    9   Q.     I don't want you to assume.    10   A.     Yeah.    11   Q.     I want you to use common sense.    12   A.     Yeah.  Using common sense and    13   basic logic, you could assume the more pills    14   that are out there, the more potential for    15   diversion there could be.    16   Q.     So if I were to tell you that a    17   company sold 100 pills and 10 of them got    18   diverted, and then I come back to you and say    19   a year later, a thousand pills got sold, what    20   does common sense and logic tell you as    21   McKesson Corporation how many pills get    22   diverted?    23   MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    24   THE WITNESS:  I don't think    25   it's that easy of a connection to say    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 26 8     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&%%iM%&ml$ft$2&%ffi.ew    1                that  happened.     There  could be many    2                different   reasons  why  a   thousand    3                pills   --   there may be  an  increase  of  a    4                thousand pills  with   zero  diversion.    5        QUESTIONS   BY   MR.    FARRELL:    6                Q.         That's  true.    7                 Do you expect as McKesson    8   Corporation to find in general a direct    9   correlation to volume of pills sold and    10   volume of pills diverted?    11                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    12         Outside the scope.    13                 THE WITNESS:  Depends.  I don't    14         know if there's a statistic on how    15         many pills are diverted.  Again,    16          there's reasons why you may have very    17          large volumes of pills for legitimate    18          reasons and there may be zero    19         diversion.    2 0       QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    21         Q.     That's true.  Let me ask it a    22   different way.    23                 Do you believe it's foreseeable    24   that the more pills you sell, the more pills    25   get diverted?    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 26 9     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^�y%^e&b%iM%&^$ft$2&%W.ew    1                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    2                 THE WITNESS:  I would say that    3          there -- that, you know, the volume    4          of -- the more pills you have, there    5          could be, could be more to diversion.    6          It doesn't mean that there is.  Or I    7         would foresee that just an increase in    8         volume is going to increase diversion.    9         There could be.    10   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    11         Q.     The more pills that are    12   diverted -- let me ask you a different way.    13         A.     Okay.    14         Q.     Does McKesson believe that the    15   more pills that get diverted, the more pills    16   get abused?    17                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    18         Outside the scope.    19                 THE WITNESS:  Sorry, could you    20          rephrase that one again?  Let me --    21   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    22         Q.     As McKesson Corporation, do you    23   acknowledge that the more pills that get    24   diverted, the more pills get abused?    25                 MS. HENN:  Same objections.

It    4          depends, but...    5   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    6         Q.     Are people diverting pills to    7   engage in lawful conduct?    8                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    9                 THE WITNESS:  I don't know why    10          everybody is diverting pills every    11          single time, but generally, no.    12   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    13          Q.      Right.    14                 So in general, the more pills    15   that gets diverted, the more abuse and    16   addiction we find with prescription opium    17   pills?    18         A.     There's that possibility.    19                 (McKesson-Hartle Exhibit 27    20         marked for identification.)    21   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    22         Q.

They got in trouble with the    21   DEA, very similar to how McKesson got in    22   trouble with the DEA in 2008, agreed?    23                 MS.

So in -- on May 9th of 2012,    4   HDMA, the Healthcare Distribution Management    5   Association, wrote a brief to a federal court    6   here in Washington, DC, in support of    7   Cardinal Health and against the DEA.    8                 Was McKesson Corporation aware    9   of this amicus brief?    10                 MS.

It's actually referenced    14          directly in the notice.    15                 MS. HENN:  I'm not sure that's    16          the case, but we can disagree about    17          that.    18                 THE WITNESS:  I don't know for    19          100 percent certain, but I assume so. 2 0       QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    21         Q.     Well, I don't want you to    22   guess.  This is relatively important. 2 3                                      Have you seen any    24   acknowledgement within McKesson Corporation    25   validating or affirming or reviewing or    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 273     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& l^MfeE^jyZ^e&bSiM^^Vft^&Vlew    1   participating in this amicus brief?    2   A.

FARRELL:    6         Q.     So should they be held    7   accountable for the societal costs that are    8   documented in this pleading and referenced as    9   huge?    10         A.     I think it depends.    11                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    12   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    13          Q.     Depends on what?    14                 MS. HENN:  Same objection.    15                 Go ahead.    16                 THE WITNESS:  It depends on the    17          facts and circumstances and, you know,    18          the information about the specific    19          situation.    2 0       QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    21         Q.     If a distributor repeatedly    22   fails to report suspicious orders, do you    23   believe it should be held accountable for the    24   societal costs of prescription drug abuse?    25                 MR.

The facts and circumstances.    7         Q.     How about the facts and    8   circumstances which led to McKesson paying    9   $150 million fine?    10                 MS.

Do you think McKesson is partly    15   responsible for the societal costs of    16   prescription drug abuse in America?    17                 MS.

We'll get to the others in a    13   second.  I want to talk about McKesson first.    14                 This is your opportunity to    15   accept partial responsibility for the    16   societal costs of prescription drug abuse in    17   America; yes or no?    18                 MS.

Well, you can say yes or --    16   A.     I understand that.    17   Q.     -- you can say no.    18   A.     I understand that.    19   MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    20   QUESTIONS BY MR.

It depends on the    4          role that they played.    5   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    6         Q.     Well, back to McKesson    7   Corporation, which is you sitting in the    8   chair today.  Knowing what you know as the    9   3 0(b)(6) representative, the corporate    10   designee, knowing about your past conduct,    11   knowing about the past interactions with the    12   DEA, I'm going to ask you again:  Does    13   McKesson Corporation accept partial    14   responsibility for the societal costs of    15   prescription drug abuse in America?    16                 MS.

FARRELL:    5                     Q.           Sir,   we're  not  going  to  parse    6       out  percentages.    7                        A.             Yeah.    8         Q.     Let's just talk globally for    9   McKesson Corporation.  So I don't want to put    10   words in your mouth because it's got to come    11   out of your mouth.  So the answer is yes or    12   no.    13                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    14                 THE WITNESS:  I would say yes,    15         partially.    16   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    17         Q.     How about Purdue Pharma?  Does    18   McKesson Corporation take the position that    19   Purdue Pharma is partially responsible for    20   the societal costs of prescription drug abuse    21   in America?    22                 MS.

So, yes.    5   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    6         Q.     Flip to page 8, the last    7   paragraph.  Your trade organization is saying    8   that the ""DEA's goal, the prevention of    9   diversion of controlled prescription drugs,    10   is, of course, a public good.""    11                 Does McKesson validate,    12   acknowledge and affirm that statement?    13                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    14                 THE WITNESS:  Absolutely.  The    15         prevention of the diversion of    16          controlled substances is good for the    17         public.    18                 (McKesson-Hartle Exhibit 29    19         marked for identification.) 2 0       QUESTIONS BY MR.

Gary Boggs is    12   former DEA.       13   A.   PowerPoint, not spreadsheet.    14   Q.   Yeah, I'm sorry.    15   A.   Okay.    16   Q.   He's former DEA, correct?    17   A.

And as we'll see later, he was    22   actually in   the room for one of the    23   presentations when DEA was negotiating with     24   McKesson on   the 2008 settlement.    25      Is that your memory as a    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 288     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�u^^gitec[:cp^^ge29Q:8h%l%ee%a^Pdfty-2gi^ew    1   corporate entity?    2                 MS.

""Protecting America from    18   Prescription Drug Diversion.""    19                 The next page is a history of    20   understanding the problem, and on page 4 it    21   talks about a collision course.    22                 And presumably this is two    23   planes colliding in the air, and that's    24   OxyContin and Percocet.    25                 Do you see that?

Which resulted in an increase    14   or decrease in the number of pills McKesson    15   sold?    16         A.     I don't know exact numbers, but    17   it increased.    18         Q.

He's one of the leaders on the    8   regulatory affairs team.    9         Q.     Okay.  And this is his    10   statement that ""Manufacturers fueled the use    11   of prescription painkillers.""    12                 Is that McKesson's position?    13                 MS.

We'll have to ask him.    20                 But I'm asking McKesson whether    21   or not it shares this view.    22                 MS.

I think there's many    10          reasons -- many things that fueled the    11          epidemic.    12   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    13          Q.

HENN:  37.    14                 MR. FARRELL:  Oh, okay, I'm    15          sorry.  But it's okay because we'll    16          just put 36 as the administrative    17         memorandum, which is 2017_01_5C,    18         MCKMDL0355513.    19                 MS. HENN:  And, Counsel, we've 2 0        been going about an hour, so if we    21          could have a break at a good stopping    22         point.  It doesn't have to be this    23          second, but if there's one very soon,    24          that would be great.    2 5                                     MR. FARRELL:  Yeah, very soon.

Just to acknowledge, McKesson's    4   still is denying liability, and this time the    5   cost has become more prohibitive with the    6   fine, 150 million.    7                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    8   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    9         Q.     Agreed?    10         a.     Agreed.  We settled with the    11   settlement agreement, agreed.    12         Q.     McKesson's distribution    13   facilities were systematically failing to    14   report suspicious orders and resulted in a    15   $150 million fine assessed by the DEA and    16   paid by McKesson Corporation; true or not    17   true?    18                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    19                 THE WITNESS:  We did pay that    20          fine, $150 million.    21   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    22         Q.     Because you were systematically    23   not reporting suspicious orders?    24                 MS. HENN:  Same objection.    25                 THE WITNESS:  That was at the    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 3 07     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&*%iM%&^$ft$mW.ew    1          core of it.    2   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    3          Q.     So let's just be fair.  There    4   were certain distribution facilities that    5   utterly failed to fulfill their obligations    6   under federal law to monitor, detect, halt    7   and report suspicious orders, which resulted    8   in McKesson paying the largest fine in the    9   history of the DEA; true or not true?    10                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    11                 THE WITNESS:  Could you    12          simplify that question a little bit?    13   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    14         Q.     Yeah.    15                 McKesson wasn't following the    16   law and got fined $150 million?    17                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    18                 THE WITNESS:  We acknowledged    19          that certain orders did not get    20          flagged in our system.    21   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    22         Q.     Thousands.    23                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    24   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    25         Q.     Thousands of orders?    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 308     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&%%iM%&^$ft$m<&ew    1   A.   Orders.    2   Q.   Like some facilities reported    3   none.       4      MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    5   QUESTIONS BY   MR. FARRELL:    6   Q.   Yes?    7   A.   Systematically none.    8   Q.   Systematically none.    9      And it wasn't just an isolated    10   distribution   facility.  It was several    11   different facilities across the spectrum at     12   McKesson had   utterly failed to comply with    13   federal regulations to prevent diversion of     14   controlled substances?     15      MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    16      THE WITNESS:  We believed we    17   were in good faith working with DEA as     18   part oj   E the 2008 agreement to report    19   customers and report orders in a     20   different way that was mutually agreed     21   upon.   So --    22   QUESTIONS BY   MR. FARRELL:    23   Q.   Yeah, I'm not asking --    24   A.   -- I would say --    25      MR. FARRELL:  You're right.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 309     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&b%iM%&^$ft$mW.ew    1         You're right.    2                 THE WITNESS:  I know you say    3          zero, but I -- you know, there are    4          situations and scenarios where we    5          reported based on what we agreed to    6         with the DEA, based on that settlement    7         agreement.    8                 So I understand systematically    9          they weren't being reported, but they    10         were being reported in other ways.    11   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    12         Q.     Sitting here today does    13   McKesson Corporation acknowledge that it    14   utterly failed in its obligations to prevent    15   diversion of opium pills into the American    16   illicit market?    17                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    18                 THE WITNESS:  No, I don't    19         believe we utterly failed.  We, again,    20          in good faith over the years have    21         worked with DEA, taken guidance,    22          developed programs, enhanced programs,    23          evolved them over the course of time.    24                 So I wouldn't characterize it    25         as utterly failing.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 310     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& l^^^^^^y^^^^^^l^^^^^^gqi^    1   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    2         Q.     Well, when you report zero    3   suspicious orders over years at the same time    4   selling tens of millions of opium pills into    5   a community, you're not meeting your    6   obligations under federal law, agreed?    7                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    8                 THE WITNESS:  Again, there's    9          certain times in which we acknowledged    10          that we did not report orders.  That    11         does not mean that we did not conduct    12          diligence, that we did not evolve our    13         program to help prevent.    14   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    15         Q.     And I understand the desire to    16   want to say in good faith you did your best.    17   What I'm asking for is a very simple    18   acknowledgement that McKesson was not    19   following the law and got fined for it on two    20   occasions.    21                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    22                 THE WITNESS:  Those were the    23          allegations.    24   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    25         Q.     Do you accept those allegations    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 311     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19^^^^^^y%y^e^^^l^^^^^2^gq^e}lj    1   as partially true?    2                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    3                 THE WITNESS:  Again, we --    4         partially, in the second agreement, we    5         did acknowledge that, you know, we    6          didn't identify all the suspicious    7         orders that we could have.    8   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    9         Q.     In fact, in some distribution    10   facilities you didn't identify any?    11                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    12   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    13          Q.     This isn't like we missed a    14   needle in a haystack.  This is we missed the    15   hay.    16                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    17                 THE WITNESS:  So the thing I    18         would just share is that, again, all    19         of those orders were blocked and not 2 0                     shipped.  And we may not have    21          systematically, as I mentioned    22          earlier, reported, but --    23                 MR. FARRELL:  Hold on.    24                 MS. HENN:  Wait, he's not done    25         with his answer.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 312     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&t%iM%&^$ft$mWlew    1                 THE WITNESS:  I'm just    2          reiterating the point I made earlier    3          about the 2 008 agreement, mutually    4          discussing with DEA the fact that we    5         were focusing on customers and would    6          report suspicious orders in a mutually    7          format --a mutually-agreed-upon    8          format.    9                 So you say zero, but it may not    10         always be zero.    11   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    12         Q.     Just to be fair with you, we're    13   going to take a break.    14         A.     All right.    15         Q.     I have the transactional data    16   in Cuyahoga and Summit County from McKesson    17   sales of opium pills.  I also have the    18   suspicious order reports.    19                 So let's be clear:  McKesson    20   didn't get in trouble for blocking orders and    21   not reporting them.  McKesson paid a record    22   fine for shipping suspicious orders and not    23   reporting them.    24                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    25                 THE WITNESS:  Say that again.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 313     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&%%iM%&ml$ft$mVlew    1                    I  want   to  be  very  clear  what   I   heard.    2   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    3          Q.      Me, too.    4         A.     Yeah.    5         Q.     You're telling me that    6   McKesson's conduct that it admitted to,    7   McKesson's position is that it blocked    8   suspicious orders and then just simply didn't    9   report them in the right way.  That's your    10   position?    11         A.     We systematically -- based on    12   the design of our system, orders were    13   blocked.    14         Q.     You believe that McKesson was    15   blocking all the suspicious orders and paid    16   $150 million because of the manner in which    17   it reported?    18         a.     Earlier I said we did    19   acknowledge that some orders, not all, we    20   didn't block.    21         Q.     Okay.  So let's get back --    22         a.     We didn't -- let me rephrase    23   that.  We acknowledge that our system may not    24   have detected orders that could be deemed as    25   suspicious.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 314     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&%%iM%&mL$ft$mW.ew    1         Q.     And that the orders that your    2   system did detect as suspicious, you still    3   shipped anyway without reporting them?    4                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    5                 THE WITNESS:  No.    6   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    7         Q.     You believe that's not true?    8         A.     Based on my understanding of    9   our systems and how things work in -- when    10   they hit a threshold and they're blocked,    11   those do not get shipped.    12         Q.     All right.  So fair --    13         a.     That's how we define those    14   suspicious orders.    15         Q.     Fair enough.    16                 Let me ask you this:  If your    17   system detects a suspicious order and you    18   ship it anyway and you don't report it, is    19   that unlawful?    20                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    21                 THE WITNESS:  Please say that    22          again.    23   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    24         Q.     if your system detects a    25   suspicious order and you ship it anyway    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 315     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^ett%iM%&mL$ft$mW.ew    1   without reporting it, is that unlawful?    2                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    3                 THE WITNESS:  I think it    4          depends.    5   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    6         Q.     On?    7         A.     There could be a technical    8   glitch --    9         Q.     Okay.    10         A.     -- or some computer error.  I    11   mean --    12         Q.     I'm talking about hundreds and    13   hundreds and hundreds of orders that are    14   red-flagged by McKesson and shipped anyway    15   without reporting a suspicious order.    16                 The US Attorney for the    17   Northern District of West Virginia doesn't    18   say this was a technical glitch.  He says it    19   was a systematic failure by your company to    20   abide by West Virginia law -- or federal law.    21                 You paid a record fine, and    22   you're disavowing the underlying conduct    23   today?    24                                           MS.   HENN:      Objection  to   form.    25                                            THE  WITNESS:      I'm  just   trying    Golkow  Litigation  Services    Page   316     Case: %i?tfnfyOmfc$&&i&BS& 19�MfeE^&y%^e&%%iM%&mL$ft$mirlew    1                    to  communicate   that   our   system  that    2                    was  designed  to  detect   suspicious    3                    orders  using  the   concept   of   thresholds    4                    blocked all   of  the   --  blocked those    5                    suspicious   orders.    6                                   We  recognize  that  and    7                    acknowledge  that   it  may not  have    8                    picked up  on  all   of   the   suspicious    9                    orders  and...    10                 MR. FARRELL:  One more and    11         we'll take a quick break.    12                 MS. HENN:  If it's okay, I'd    13          like to take it now.  It's been now an    14         hour and 15 minutes.  It's pretty    15          tiring to be a witness.  So if we    16          could just take a five-minute break,    17          that would be great.    18                 MR. FARRELL:  Okay.    19                 MS.

So what I'm going to do is    20          I'm going to finish up some topics,    21         and I'm going to state for the record    22          that I have not been able to get    23          through all of the designated topics    24          today.    25                 That being said, there are some    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 318     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&%%iM%&mL$ft$m&ew    1                additional   topics  that  you were  not    2                designated  for.     There's   essentially    3                two  notices.    4                 So what we're -- what I'm going    5          to do is recommend that I finish up    6          the topics that I want to get to, and    7          then tomorrow is your fact deposition.    8         And what we'll do is work out with    9          counsel if there are any of these    10         questions that can be answered in    11         writing to avoid you having to come    12         back and testify on things that can be    13          answered.    14                 And then in addition, there are    15          records and there are -- there is    16          transactional data historically and    17          suspicious order report historically    18          that have not been disclosed yet    19         because of our tight schedules that    20          I'll -- I will be going to ask --    21          eventually to ask for some additional    22          time from you to finish the stuff we    23          didn't get to finish and to ask    24          questions about documents that have    25         not been disclosed yet.

FARRELL:    6         Q.     Jumping in real quick, I'm not    7   going to spend a whole lot of time on this; I    8   have a very specific question.    9                 Before we get into the    10   document, there's a reference in here about    11   heroin, and I just wanted to see if I could    12   cut to the chase with you.    13         A.     Okay.    14         Q.     As the McKesson corporate    15   representative, do you acknowledge that abuse    16   of prescription opium pills is a gateway to    17   the initiation of heroin?    18                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    19         Outside the scope.    20                 THE WITNESS:  Based on    21          everything that I've read and in the    22         media and statistics and discussion, I    23         would agree -- agree to that.    24        QUESTIONS   BY   MR.    FARRELL:    25                         Q.             if  you abuse  prescription    Golkow  Litigation  Services    Page   32 0     Case: %i?tfnfyOmfc$&&i&BS& 19�MfeE^�y%^e&%%iM%&mL$ft$2&&lew    1   opiates, the CDC says that you're 4 0 times    2   more likely to initiate heroin use.    3   Does McKesson acknowledge    4   that -- that prescription opiate pill abuse    5   is a driving factor in the heroin epidemic    6   we're also experiencing?    7   MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    8   Outside the scope.    9   THE WITNESS:  Yeah, it'S a    10   factor.    11   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    12   Q.     That was easy.    13   A.     Yeah.    14   Q.     All right.  Back to this amicus    15   business.    16   (McKesson-Hartle Exhibit 38    17   marked for identification.)    18   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    19   Q.     I'm going to mark as    20   Exhibit 38, it's 2016_04_04.  This is another    21   amicus brief.  This one is Masters    22   Pharmaceutical.    23   Does McKesson acknowledge that    24   in 2016 when this amicus brief was submitted    25   that it was still on the executive committee    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 321     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&%%iM%&ml$ft$mi&ew    1   of HDMA?    2                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    3          Outside the scope.    4                 THE WITNESS:  I can't speak to    5          that.  If I saw a list of who was on    6          the executive committee...    7                 (McKesson-Hartle Exhibit 39    8         marked for identification.)    9   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    10         Q.     Fair enough.  Exhibit 39,    11   2016_04_05, the Wayback Machine.    12                 So looking at the Exhibit 39,    13   can you acknowledge that McKesson was on the    14   executive board of HDMA --    15         a.     Yes.    16         Q.     --at the time that this amicus    17   brief was submitted?    18         A.     Yes.    19         Q.     Have you had a chance to review    20   the amicus brief?    21         A.     I had a chance to look at some    22   of the highlighted sections.    23          Q.     So let's go to 2016_04_04,    24   page 5.    25         a.     Page 5.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 32 2     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&b%iM%&ml$ft$mW.ew    1         Q.     Down the right-hand side, you    2   can see two-thirds of the way down it starts,    3   ""DEA.""  The one below that.  Yeah.    4                 ""DEA has required distributors    5   not only to report suspicious orders but to    6   investigate orders by interrogating    7   pharmacies and physicians and take action to    8   halt suspicious orders before they are    9   filled.  Those added obligations would    10   significantly expand a report-only duty of    11   distributors under the long-standing    12   regulatory scheme and impose impractical    13   obligations on distributors.""    14                 Is that McKesson's position?    15                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    16         Outside the scope.    17                 THE WITNESS:  Obviously we're    18         part of the organization.  In parts,    19         you know, I agree with the added --    20         what it would -- you know, the added    21          responsibility or time that it would    22          take to -- you know, to investigate    23          each order.    24                 I don't know if I'm answering    25         your question, but...

You're stumbling toward it.    3         A.     Yeah.    4         Q.     Let's go to page 6, a little    5   more direct.  The second highlighted    6   provision:  ""As the final order in this case    7   underscores, however, DEA now appears to have    8   changed its position to require that    9   distributors not only report suspicious    10   orders but investigate and halt suspicious    11   orders.""    12                 This is a 2016 document by your    13   trade organization, of which McKesson sits on    14   the executive board, and its telling the DC    15   Circuit Court of Appeals that it does not    16   have a duty to investigate and halt    17   suspicious orders.    18                 Does McKesson validate this    19   position?    20                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    21                 THE WITNESS:  Can you rephrase    22          that for me?    23   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    24         Q.     Yeah.    25                 In 2016, your trade    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 324     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&%%iM%&^$ft$2&$tt.ew    1   organization is telling the second highest    2   court in the land, the DC Circuit Court of    3   Appeals, that the DEA is now requiring them    4   to investigate and halt suspicious orders.    5                 Haven't we agreed that's been    6   the duty since 1971?    7                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    8         Outside the scope.    9   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    10         Q.     Tough position to defend, isn't    11   it?    12                 MS. HENN:  Same objections.    13                 THE WITNESS:  You know, again,    14          I -- I recognize that other    15         distributors have different systems    16          and have worked with DEA over the    17         years on different methodologies,    18         whether it's a threshold to block it    19         or it's a hold and investigate and    20          then block it.  And so, you know, I    21          recognize that.    22   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    23          Q.     You recognize this position is    24   problematic given your experience, McKesson    25   Corporation, with the DEA?

FARRELL:    6         Q.      Yeah.    7                 But we're still trying to    8   figure out from internal communications    9   whether or not McKesson signed off on this    10   brief.    11                 Are you aware of whether or not    12   they signed off on this?    13                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    14                 THE WITNESS:  I don't -- I am    15         not aware of the process that goes    16          into signing off on these briefs and    17         what that specific looks like.  I know    18         how trade organizations work and how    19          they get to a point of consensus. 2 0       QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    21        Q.     Let me ask you in a different    2 2        way.    23                 We talked about the original    24   enactment of the Controlled Substances Act    25   where the penalty for engaging in unlawful    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 32 6     Case: ki?fmfyOmfc$&&i&BS& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&%%iM%&^$ft$2&$ftew    1   conduct should be prohibitive.    2                 Do you remember talking about    3   that this morning?    4         A.     I do.    5         Q.     And so in 2008, McKesson    6   Corporation paid $13 million, and in 2017,    7   McKesson paid $150 million.    8                 What would happen in today's    9   world if McKesson went to the DEA and said,    10   ""We don't have a duty to investigate and halt    11   suspicious orders""?  What do you reckon would    12   happen then?    13                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    14         Outside the scope.    15                 THE WITNESS:  I'm not sure    16          exactly what would happen, but they    17         wouldn't be thrilled.    18   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    19         Q.     So what do you think the fine    20   will be next time?    21         A.     I can't speculate what it would    22   be.  It depends on the facts and    23   circumstances and...    24         Q.     So just simply stated, sitting    25   here today, McKesson Corporation, do you    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 32 7     Case: ki?fmfyOmfc$&&i&BS& 19�MfeE^&y%^e&*%iM%&^$ft$mW.ew    1   accept or reject the position your trade    2   organization is taking regarding the    3   interpretation of the shipping requirement    4   and reporting requirement?    5                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    6         Outside the scope.    7                 THE WITNESS:  I apologize.  Can    8         you ask -- ask me again or rephrase?    9         Do we accept --    10   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    11         Q.     Yeah.    12                 The sentence you see up there    13   on the screen --    14         a.     Yeah.    15         Q.     -- submitted by your trade    16   organization to which McKesson sits as an    17   executive board member, this is a position in    18   a legal document submitted to the second    19   highest court in the United States of    20   America.    21                 Sitting here today, does    22   McKesson Corporation accept or reject this    23   position?    24                 MS.

As being part of that    9   organization.    10         Q.     So your position today is    11   McKesson does not have a duty to investigate    12   and halt suspicious orders?    13                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    14   QUESTIONS BY MR.

Basically, the position in this    12   brief is they're trying to figure out how in    13   the world that 2006 letter became a command    14   to distributors to engage in due diligence    15   and avoid filling suspicious orders.    16                 MS.

You get the gist of what I'm    8   asking you?    9         A.     Can you ask it in a different    10   way?    11         Q.     Yeah.    12                 This appears to say that    13   McKesson does not have a duty to engage in    14   due diligence, nor does it need to avoid    15   filling suspicious orders.    16                 Is that your position sitting    17   here today?    18                 MS.

HENN:  Objection to form.    3                 THE WITNESS:  I can say -- I    4          can't say that it's nonsense.  I'm not    5          sure how to answer this one    6          specifically.    7   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    8         Q.     Go to page Bates stamp 9.    9   ""Nothing in the federal regulations requires    10   distributors to investigate the legitimacy of    11   orders or to halt shipments of any orders    12   deemed to be suspicious.""    13                 Does McKesson disavow this    14   statement or agree with it?    15                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    16                 THE WITNESS:  You know, I do    17          think the language of the regulations,    18         you know, ""design and operate a system    19          to disclose suspicious orders,"" gets    20          interpreted in many different ways,    21         and that -- and that's how different    22          organizations, distributors, develop    23          their program.    24   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    25         Q.     Respectfully, that's how you    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 332     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&b%iM%&mL$ft$2&$&ew    1   get fined $150 million.    2                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    3   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    4         Q.     The next sentence:  ""There is    5   no prohibition on shipment of suspicious    6   orders.""    7                 That's wrong, isn't it?    8                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    9   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    10         Q.     Make it easier.  Let's go to    11   page 12.    12                 ""DEA's regulations had sensibly    13   imposed a duty on distributors simply to    14   report suspicious orders, but left it to DEA    15   and its agents to investigate and halt    16   suspicious orders.""    17                 Nonsense or not nonsense?    18                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    19   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    2 0        Q.     Or no comment?  I'm giving you    21   an out.    22         a.     I would say no comment.  I'm    23   not sure how to answer that specifically.    24         Q.     Well, the answer should be    25   someone needs to call HDMA and figure out why    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 33 3     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&%%iM%&^$ft$2&$�lew    1   they're taking nonsense positions, but I'll    2   leave that to somebody else.    3                 All right.  Homestretch.  Some    4   toys.  As many at this table probably know,    5   I'm the ARC0S nerd.    6                 You're familiar with ARC0S?    7         A.     I'm familiar with what it is,    8   yep.    9         Q.     I'm the guy that's been banging    10   away trying to get access to ARCOS for the    11   better part of a year and a half, and I got    12   some.    13                 Now, what this is is the    14   transactions by every distributor in the    15   country between 2006 and 2014, and it's    16   related to Cuyahoga and Summit County.  Now,    17   we also have the rest of the country, so I'm    18   able to determine national averages, state    19   averages and county averages for every    20   distributor, including McKesson.  But we're    21   not going to get into all of that today    22   because what I really need is I need the    23   transactional data dating back to 1996.  I'm    24   missing a decade.  I have '06 to 2014.    25                 Last week, July 25th, your    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 334     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^�y%^e&%%iM%&^$ft$2&&lew    1        counsel  provided a  spreadsheet   that  gave us    2         2006   to  2018.     All   right?     So  we've  had  it    3         for a week.      I  played with  it  a  little  bit.    4                                            But   I   don't  have  the  decade    5         from  the   launch  of   OxyContin  to  2006   yet,   but    6         I'm working  on   it.      So  one   day we  may  come    7        back and have  to  talk  about  this    8         transactional   data   in  a  different   context.    9                                           But  that  being  said,   one  of  the    10         interesting  things   that   I   did was   I   grabbed    11        the  data provided by your  counsel,   and  I    12        pulled  it  up  and took  a  look at   it.    13                                            MR.    FARRELL:      Corey,    can  you    14                         pull   that  up?    15        QUESTIONS   BY   MR.    FARRELL:    16         Q.     Now, the first thing I want you    17   to note is this is highly confidential.    18   Nobody in here is allowed to talk about it    19   outside this room.    20                 And it's MCKMDL00478913.    21                 MR. FARRELL:  Is that right?    22                 MS. HENN:  I see    23                         MCKMDL00478913.      That  may be   the   same.    24        QUESTIONS   BY   MR.    FARRELL:    25                         Q.             Okay.      Can  either  you  or  your    Golkow  Litigation  Services    Page   33 5     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&^%iM%&ml$ft$2&$%.ew    1   counsel confirm that this is the complete    2   transactional data for McKesson in Cuyahoga    3   and Summit counties between 2006 and 2018?    4 5    9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20    ? ? ? ? ?    MS. HENN:  Object to form.    Go ahead.    THE WITNESS:  I wasn't involved in pulling it, so I can't -- without seeing, I can't confirm that it's everything.    MR. FARRELL:  Yeah, it's really a question for your counsel, but I'm not allowed to put her under oath, so I'm hoping she'll volunteer.    MS. HENN:  That's my understanding, but I'm not the person who is most knowledgeable about this, so you should ask one of my colleagues. QUESTIONS BY MR.

Because remember, there was a    10   period of time where there were 300,000    11   prescriptions of OxyContin, and then -- in    12    '96, and then by 2001 there were 6 million,    13   right?    14                 So when we get the data for the    15   first ten years, we're going to see a    16   progression of the number of pills being    17   delivered.  Okay?    18                 So one of the things that I'm    19   going to have you do is we're able to do some    20   analysis with the ARCOS data.    21                 MR. FARRELL:  So, Corey, if    22         you'll bring up Summit County PDF. 2 3                                     MS. HENN:  Do you have a    24          document that we can look at?

So you understand the position    5   about reporting suspicious customers McKesson    6   made to the United States District Attorney    7   in northern West Virginia and resulted in    8   you-all getting fined 150 million.

PagelD #: 128084    MEMORANDUM    November 2,2010    To:     Karen Harper    From: Howard Davis    Subject: Suspicious Order Monitoring Program No. C/S Comp 3.0    Reference is made to Mallinckrodt Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) C/S Comp 3,0 entitled: ""Identification and Review of Peculiar Orders"" which publishes the Peculiar Order Report for orders in excess of ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^j]    I                                                                               I. The algorithms have been    established to identify whether a customer is deviating from a normal order pattern, and/of increasing in frequency,,    The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has implemented a strict *due diligence program* to maintain effective controls and procedures to guard against theft and diversion of controlled substances (21 Code of Federal Regulations 1301.71).. It is also a Statutory public health and safety registration requirement under Title 21 United States Code (USC) 823 and a basis for revocation of a DEA registration under 21USC824, Under the due diligence program, as published in numerous Federal Register notices and related DEA correspondence to the registrant population, DEA has determined that algorithms and/or arithmetic formulas to define whether an order is suspicious may be failing to detect suspicious orders. Federal Register notices published as early as 2007 (72 Federal Register 36487) state specifically that using formulas that rely on percentages or averages over time has been determined, by the DEA, to be insufficient. The DEA registrant population, especially (but not exclusively) at the wholesale level now must be aware of and implement safeguards to guard against diversion through excessive or suspicious orders. In effect, the DEA has eliminated what was once only a few years ago a suspicious order reporting system that many viewed as absolving liability on the part of the DEA registrant if the order was filled, although suspicious, upon DEA notification,    An order must not be processed and filled if it is either suspicious or excessive. The existing SOP excels to meet this requirement through a specific evaluation process. However, the numeric formula is problematic. For example, should an occasion arise where an order is three times over the historical average for that customer and item or in a situation where the order meets but does not exceed the f''^ criteria, ft Would theoretically be filled through normal processing without further question. In doing so in certain cases and as noted in recent immediate suspensions of other large scale DEA registrants, which are all a matter of public record, Mallinckrodt would be unnecessarily exposing itself to potential liability, The fundamental basis of the immediate suspensions in question were suspicious order monitoring deficiencies.

PagelD #: 128085    Numeric formulas do not identify circumstances that might be indicative of diversion such as: ordering larger quantities of a limited variety regularly that would otherwise not be viewed as suspicious (like ordering controlled substances with few, if any, other drugs or products whether controlled or non-controlled); ordering highly abused controlled substances in limited quantities disproportionate to other products; or even ordering the same controlled substances from multiple suppliers. DEA's due diligence program requires the registrant population to ""know your customer"" as part of an effective suspicious order monitoring program to insure that these examples of representative issues are not occurring.    The DEA registrant population as a whole is now required to consider the totality of the circumstances when evaluating an order prior to it being filled, just as the DEA will do in determining if the registrant is operating within the public interest within the meaning of 21USC823 and 824, which are the statutory requirements for obtaining a DEA registration and grounds for denial, suspension or revocation. While not all inclusive, recommended customer inquiries may include such factors as:    �    What percentage of business do controlled substances constitute?    �    Is the customer complying with other federal, State, local requirements/laws?    �    Is the customer soliciting and/or supplying customers via the Internet unlawfully? � ?   Does the customer have a business relationship with a physician or other business    partner who authorizes prescriptions over the Internet?    �   . Are prescribing practitioners licenses in the State where the controlled substances    are being shipped?    �    Are shipments made where the majority of the ultimate customers are serviced from the same practitioner who routinely authorizes ""cocktail"" prescriptions, I.e., drug combinations that compound or have an antagonistic effect?    �    Are controlled substances sold to retail outlets that further dispense them without a prescription?    �    Does the customer sell controlled substances for market prices or well above state-of-the-art pricing modules?    �    Are sells made to customers, or their customers, on a cash only basis or are insurance plans accepted?    Therefore, 1 recommend the immediate revision of SOP No. C/S Comp 3.0 to include additional definitive criteria, as noted above, such that a more vigilant detennination can be made whether the order is suspicious and/or excessive prior to filling any order, in concert with numeric formulas already in place as the Company deems appropriate. Thus, the Company can assure and reference procedures that insure regulatory and statutory compliance with the public interest provisions under the Controlled Substances Act as circumstances warrant upon request. A new draft SOP entitled: ""Due Diligence Procedures and Monitoring of Controlled Substances Sales"" is included for consideration aS a replacement or to be used in addition to the current SOP on file to comply with the DEA's newest interpretation of enhanced and certainly more strict due diligence requirements,    Confidential    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL�SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    MAL-Ml 000010525 MNK-T1 0000269400 "

Attached is the powerpoint presentation and draft Customer Checklist that were discussed.    Feedback was very positive and there were good suggestions about which type of bulk customers might be considered for automatic exemption such as universities and customers who have an existing registered product, having filed an NDA or ANDA petition with FDA.    Further, a request that bulk narcotics CSRs be given some type of substantive guidance in terms of acceptance of orders on Research or Analytical Lab DEA 222 forms.    The group found it significant and noteworthy that confirmation of a customer's current DEA registration status and receipt of a DEA 222 Form are not alone adequate in determining whether an order is suspicious.    We encouraged additional comments and feedback on the draft Customer Checklist and list of triggers, there was no opposition to the concept that Field Sales is key in knowing our customers and that Customer Checklist would be an integral part of the revised Suspicious Order Monitoring Program.

Since I don't hold the orders up during my due diligence it's possible that the order could ship.

Pretty well    Interesting, the group decided that the actual day-to-day monitoring responsibility should be    switched to a non-customer service function in that those that have responsibility to manage    the orders have a conflict of interest in deciding which orders should ultimately be shipped    -- with ultimate right of refusal retained by Controlled Substance Compliance.    Trade Compliance stepped up to the plate and the obligation will be transferred to them, they    have access to contractual and pricing data and are located physically in Building 10 so that    they can more readily check with Commercial Group.    The Peculiar Order report would be vetted by them and okayed by Controlled Substance    Compliance on a daily basis.    First transition meeting will be set up next week.    Other sub-teams include:    1)Review of indirect customer data availability and make a recommendation for Steering    Committee Review as to how we should use the information and what the resource requirements    should be    2)Revamp of the existing Customer Checklist to include a question such as: do you (as our    customer) verify that your customers have a CFR compliant Suspicious Order Monitoring Program    3)Customer Audit Checklist preparation and recommendation for Steering Committee about    frequency of audits, who should be on the audit team, etc.    Karen Harper    Mallinckrodt/Covidien Pharmaceuticals    Senior Manager, Controlled Substance Compliance    Global Logistics Group    office phone (314) 654-1868    cellular (314) 401-1573    This information may be confidential and/or privileged.

KO: Before we get started,    09:10:30    8          I just wanted to note for the record      09:10:32    9          that yesterday evening Mallinckrodfs     09:10:33    10          counsel had provided some documents,      09:10:35    11          another production of documents,          09:10:38    12          including some documents apparently       09:10:39    13          from Ms. Harper's custodial file. It     09:10:40    14          appears to be a fairly substantial        09:10:44    15          production.                              09:10:46    16                  We didn't get a chance to          09:10:47    17          review those, so I just wanted to note    09:10:48    18          for the record that we reserve the        09:10:49    19          right to reopen this deposition based     09:10:50    20          on that review.                          09:10:52    21                  MR.

Earlier in my life, before I       09:11:32    21    was an employee of Mallinckrodt.                09:11:35    22           Q.     Okay.

I think we're here for a fairly    09:12:25    4    long time today, so to the extent you need      09:12:27    5    breaks throughout the day, please feel free     09:12:30    6    to ask and I'll do my best to accommodate.      09:12:33    7                  Okay?                              09:12:35    8           A.

Great.                             09:12:46    14                  Ms. Harper, what did you do to     09:12:47    15    prepare for this deposition today?              09:12:51    16           A.     I met with my attorneys.           09:12:52    17           Q.     Okay. And who are they?           09:12:54    18           A.     Ropes & Gray.                      09:12:55    19           Q.

At least one other.                09:13:06    Page 15    1    probably some of the ground rules, but I just   09:11:42    2    want to remind you of a few that are            09:11:44    3    important to me today.                         09:11:47    4                  The court reporters have the       09:11:48    5    most important job here in transcribing         09:11:49    6    everything that we're saying, so it's           09:11:52    7    important that we don't talk over one           09:11:53    8    another. So please wait until I finish my      09:11:54    9    question before you move on to your response,   09:11:56    10    and likewise, I'll wait until you finish your   09:11:58    11    question {sic} before I move on to my next      09:12:00    12    question.                                     09:12:03    13        Does that sound good?     09:12:03    14     A.  Yes.                                  09:12:04    15          Q.     And to the extent I ask a yes      09:12:05    16    or no question, I would ask that you actually   09:12:07    17    in fact answer yes or no, if that's your        09:12:11    18    response, rather than shaking your head or      09:12:11    19    nodding your head.                             09:12:15    20          A.     Understood.                       09:12:16    21          Q.     Okay. And from time to time       09:12:16    22    counsel at this table may object to my          09:12:17    23    questioning, but unless you get a clear         09:12:19    24    instruction not to respond, I would ask that    09:12:21    25    you re spond to my que stion.                    09:12:23    Page 17    1          Q.     Okay. And how many times did      09:13:08    2    you meet?                                      09:13:09    3          A.     Five times.                       09:13:09    4          Q.     Okay. So you met for five         09:13:10    5    different days or five different sessions?      09:13:13    6          A.     Five different sessions.           09:13:14    7          Q.     Okay. And how many hours total    09:13:16    8    would you say that would be?                   09:13:17    9          A.     The first two sessions were        09:13:18    10    eight--two eight-hour days, so 16 and 16,     09:13:21    11    32. Then we had an eight-hour day, 40, and     09:13:26    12    another two eight-hour days. So 56 hours.      09:13:30    13          Q.     Sounds like a lot of              09:13:34    14    preparation.                                   09:13:36    15                  Other than your outside            09:13:37    16    counsel, or other than Ropes & Gray, were       09:13:42    17    there any other people present during your      09:13:44    18    meetings?                                      09:13:49    19          A.

And I believe I've seen     09:35:18    3    plenty of references to that group in the       09:35:21    4    documents, but is that � correct me if I'm     09:35:23    5    wrong, but is that a type of industry working   09:35:27    6    group?                                        09:35:28    7           A.

Okay. Why not?                   09:36:58    4          A.     My job was full time and my        09:36:59    5    husband was ill, so I did not participate in    09:37:08    6    extracurricular activities, if you will.        09:37:12    7          Q.

That's incorrect.                 09:37:38    18          Q.     Okay. It's more accurate to       09:37:39    19    say that you've been senior manager for some    09:37:41    20    period less than 17 years when considering      09:37:44    21    that you joined the controlled substance        09:37:46    22    compliance group in 2001?                      09:37:48    23          A.

The same as they were as          09:38:01    4    manager, except with one exception. I had �   09:38:06    5    when the company met with DEA, I was present    09:38:12    6    at those meetings where I had not been         09:38:16    7    necessarily in my previous position.           09:38:19    8          Q.     Okay. So in your previous        09:38:21    9    position, you had never communicated � or      09:38:22    10    never met with the DEA, but when you became     09:38:26    11    senior manager, you became more involved and    09:38:29    12    met actually with the DEA?                    09:38:32    13                 MR.

All through my career in          09:38:37    19    controlled substances compliance, I            09:38:40    20    communicated with DEA in the course of         09:38:41    21    inspections and on quota requests.             09:38:46    22          Q.     Okay. And so how did that        09:38:51    23    change when you became senior manager?         09:38:54    24          A.

Prior to that, the controlled      09:40:54    7    substances compliance group at each facility    09:40:59    8    operated reporting to the management of their   09:41:02    9    separate sites. And so eventually the group    09:41:07    10    became one, and my position provided a         09:41:11    11    corporate oversight for all the facilities      09:41:14    12    that had controlled substances compliance       09:41:17    13    personnel.                                    09:41:19    14          Q.     Okay. And when you became         09:41:19    15    senior manager, those responsibilities          09:41:22    16    continued, correct?                           09:41:24    17          A.     Yes.                             09:41:25    18          Q.     Okay. And as you said, you        09:41:26    19    started interacting with the DEA on a more      09:41:28    20    regular basis.                                09:41:31    21                  Do you recall when you first       09:41:32    22    started communicating with the DEA more         09:41:35    23    frequently?                                   09:41:37    24                  MR.

KO:                           09:50:43    17          Q.     Okay. So when you say ""we         09:50:43 already had a system in place,"" first of all,   09:50:44 when � what time period are you talking        09:50:48 about right now?                                09:50:49    A.     All the way back to my days        09:50:50 before controlled substances compliance, I      09:50:55 was aware that we had a system in place         09:50:58    2 4   designed to detect orders of unusual pattern,   09:51:02 25    size and frequency.                            09:51:05    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    10    11    12    13    14    15    Page 60    1    had responsibility, if they saw anything that   09:52:20    2    appeared to be unusual to them, to escalate     09:52:22    3    to their manager.                             09:52:24    4                 We took precautions to make        09:52:26    5    certain that every single order we shipped     09:52:28    6    was to a valid DEA registration, every order    09:52:30    7    for Schedule II drugs was � that we received   09:52:35    8    a 222 form that was filled out correctly, and   09:52:39    9    that the order - the address on the 222        09:52:42    10    forms coincided exactly with the ship to        09:52:45    11    address in our company's order management      09:52:48    12    system.                                      09:52:51    13          Q.     Okay. And I want to get an       09:52:52    14    understanding of when these elements were in   09:52:53    15    place, because I've reviewed a lot of          09:52:57    16    documents in this case and I've been able to    09:53:00    17    determine � or at least from my               09:53:02    18    interpretation I've been able to see some of   09:53:04    19    these things that you have discussed during     09:53:07    20    certain time periods. But I want to           09:53:08    21    understand what you said a moment ago when      09:53:10    22    you said that Mallinckrodt always had a        09:53:14    23    system.                                      09:53:15    24                 Do you recall that testimony?      09:53:15    25          A.     Yes, I do.                       09:53:17    Page 59 Q.     Okay. And what did that          09:51:07    system � what was your understanding of what   09:51:09 that system consisted of?                      09:51:11    A.     There was a algorithm in �        09:51:14 programmed by IT into our order entry system    09:51:20 that would flag orders for further review.      09:51:26    Q.     Okay. Other than that            09:51:29    algorithm, were there any other elements of    09:51:32 that system?                                  09:51:35    A.     Yes, quite a few others.           09:51:36    Q.     Okay. And what did those          09:51:39    consist of?                                   09:51:41    A.     So we had commercial              09:51:42    representative � national account managers     09:51:46    15    that were our eyes and ears and boots on the    09:51:49    16    ground at the customer accounts. We trained    09:51:51    17    them to be vigilant for any potential sign �   09:51:54 red flags that could be indicative of          09:51:59 diversion as they visited customers.            09:52:01    May I go on, please?              09:52:05    Q.     Yeah.                             09:52:06    A.     We have customer service           09:52:07    representatives who are veteran in the          09:52:08    24    business, and they were in general familiar     09:52:10    25    with customers'order patterns, and so they     09:52:13    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    10    11    12    13    14    Page 61    1          Q.     Are these things that you're       09:53:18    2    describing, are you testifying that             09:53:20    3    Mallinckrodt always had all these elements in   09:53:21    4    connection with the suspicious order            09:53:26    5    monitoring program?                            09:53:29    6                  MR.

The suspicious order monitoring    09:53:59    21    program, as you understand it, consisted of     09:54:01    22    both an algorithm and other factors that you    09:54:04    23    had previously described; is that correct?      09:54:07    24          A.     Yes.                              09:54:07    25          Q.     Okay. Now, setting aside what     09:54:09    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 16 (58 - 61)     Case: ^^-Qmt^m^t^m.#^W^<^^b 0?{&&�^^�diSm\9.$t�l@&.ev,    Page 62    1    you understood to be the � by the way, do      09:54:13    2    you mind if I call suspicious order            09:54:17    3    monitoring ""SOM"" for short?                   09:54:19    4          A.     I don't mind.                    09:54:20    5          Q.     Okay. Other than what you        09:54:21    6    believe to be the elements of Mallinckrodt's    09:54:25    7    SOM program, when you became involved as a      09:54:28    8    senior manager of the controlled substances     09:54:33    9    compliance group, is it accurate to say that    09:54:36    10    one of your primary responsibilities was to     09:54:39    11    design and implement a system to identify       09:54:41    12    suspicious orders?                           09:54:44    13                 MR. O'CONNOR: Object to form.     09:54:44    14                 THE WITNESS: So, sir, we         09:54:45    15          already had a system in place to         09:54:47    16          identify suspicious orders.              09:54:49    17    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                          09:54:51    18          Q.     Okay. Well, it's my              09:54:51    19    understanding that you revised that system      09:54:55    2 0    over time when you were a senior manager.       09:54:58    21                 Is that fair to say?              09:55:00    22          A.     Yes.                            09:55:01    23          Q.     Okay. So during the time that     09:55:02    24    you were senior manager, is it accurate to      09:55:05    25    say that you continued to help design and       09:55:06    Page 64    1          Q.     That's okay.                      09:56:03    2                  And when you say ""may be,"" is      09:56:04    3    one way to say it that a fundamental feature    09:56:08    4    of a SOM program is to guard against the        09:56:12    5    potential diversion of controlled substances?   09:56:16    6                  MR. O'CONNOR: Object to form.     09:56:17    7                  THE WITNESS: Yes.                 09:56:18    8    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                           09:56:20    9          Q.     Okay. And guarding against the    09:56:20    10    diversion of prescription opioids is an         09:56:23    11    important responsibility of a company that      09:56:25    12    manufactures prescription opioids; wouldn't     09:56:28    13    you say?                                      09:56:29    14          A.     Yes.                              09:56:31    15          Q.     Okay. And as we discussed         09:56:32    16    before, the CSA imposes that obligation on      09:56:33    17    registrants in the supply chain, including on   09:56:37 Mallinckrodt, correct?                         09:56:39    MR. O'CONNOR: Object to form.     09:56:40 THE WITNESS: Yes.                 09:56:40    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                           09:56:41    Q.     And would you agree with me        09:56:43 that that would be one of the most              09:56:45    fundamental duties of the CSA?                 09:56:46    MR. O'CONNOR: Object to form.     09:56:48    Page 63    1    implement Mallinckrodt's suspicious order       09:55:10    2    monitoring system?                             09:55:12    3           A.     Yes.                              09:55:13    4           Q.     Okay. Now, a fundamental          09:55:14    5    feature of any SOM program is to prevent        09:55:17    6    diversion of controlled substances, so just     09:55:20    7    prescription opioids manufactured by            09:55:23    8    Mallinckrodt; is that correct?                 09:55:24    9                  MR. O'CONNOR: Object to form.     09:55:25    10                  THE WITNESS: Not to prevent,      09:55:26    11          but to guard against diversion.           09:55:30    12    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                           09:55:32    13           Q.     Okay. So you have a              09:55:32    14    distinction between prevent and guard           09:55:33    15    against?                                       09:55:36    16          A.     Yes.                              09:55:36    17           Q.     Okay. And what is that            09:55:36    18    distinction?                                   09:55:38    19          A.     So prevent is an absolute. It     09:55:38    20    means we can assure that there's never any      09:55:41    21    diversion of our product.                      09:55:44    22                  Guard against means to the         09:55:46    23    extent we're able, detect orders that may       09:55:50    24    be � that are cause for further review,        09:56:00    25    sorry.                                         09:56:02    Page 65    1                  THE WITNESS: The CSA covers       09:56:48    2          many aspects, my understanding, for �    09:56:53    3          to maintain the closed system of         09:56:57    4          distribution, and suspicious order        09:57:00    5          monitoring is one of those components.    09:57:02    6    QUESTIONS BY MR.

Sure.                             09:57:03    8                  And I understand that there are    09:57:04    9    a lot of aspects to the CSA, but from your      09:57:06    10    perspective, would you agree with me that       09:57:09    11    guarding against diversion, as you put it, is   09:57:12    12    one of the fundamental duties of the CSA?       09:57:15    13                  MR.

Correct.                          09:57:37    23          Q.     And these revisions occurred       09:57:38    24    generally in the 2000 - the late, I guess I    09:57:42    25    would say � I would describe it this way.      09:57:49    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 17 (62 - 65)     Case: ^^-Qmt^m^t^m.#^W^<^^b 0?{&&�^^�diSm\9.$t�l@&.ev,    Page 66    1                  These revisions occurred          09:57:50    2    sometime between the 2008 and 2012 time         09:57:52    3    period.

Do you recall any instances in     09:58:45    8    which you met with DEA prior to that in which  09:58:55    9    you discussed Mallinckrodt's SOM program?       09:58:59    10          A.

Thank you.                 10:00:46    7                 When you referenced the            10:00:46    8    commercial group a moment ago, what did that    10:00:51    9    consist of?                                   10:00:56    10                 In other words, who were           10:00:57    11    members of that commercial group?              10:00:59    12          A.     Primarily John Adams.             10:01:00    13          Q.     Anyone else?                      10:01:05    14          A.     A gentleman named Steve Becker.    10:01:07    15          Q.     Okay. And Steve Becker was a      10:01:09    16   national account manager, correct?    10:01:14    17          A.     Correct.                         10:01:15    18          Q.     Okay. Were there any other        10:01:16    19    customer service representatives that were      10:01:18    10:01:19    A.     Yes.                             10:01:20    Q.     Okay. Who were they?             10:01:21    A.     The lady's name is Brenda          10:01:22    24    Rehkop; she's passed away. Cathy Stewart.      10:01:29    25    JimRausch.                                   10:01:35    2 0   part of that group?    21 22 23    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 18 (66 - 69)     case: ^^-Qmt^m^t^m.#^w^<^^b o?{m^^^�d<^m$t�~zm�eW    Page 70    1          Q.     And Jim Rausch was part of        10:01:36    2    commercial?                                  10:01:40    3          A.     Well, we distinguish -           10:01:40    4    customer service is not considered to be part   10:01:46    5    of commercial, although it would seem that it   10:01:47    6    would be, so customer service is a separate     10:01:49    7    group.                                      10:01:51    8          Q.     Okay. Than commercial you're      10:01:51    9    saying?                                     10:01:53    10          A.     Yes.                            10:01:53    11          Q.     Now, you mentioned some names      10:01:54    12    of people that have been deposed previously     10:01:57    13    in this case in the past few weeks. Many of    10:02:01    14    them have testified that you are the person     10:02:05    15    most knowledgeable about Mallinckrodt's SOM     10:02:07    16    program.                                     10:02:10    17                 Would you agree with that         10:02:10    18    assessment?                                  10:02:11    19                 MR. O'CONNOR: Object to form.     10:02:11    20                 THE WITNESS: Well, I'm not a      10:02:12    21          vain person, but, yes, I know a lot       10:02:17    22          about the program, but it's all been      10:02:18    23          with the contributions of a � a team     10:02:20    24          effort as time has gone on.              10:02:22 25    Page 72    1    dispensing and consumption of controlled        10:03:34    2    substances.                                    10:03:39    3                  So we have many programs within    10:03:40    4    Mallinckrodt, as a responsible manufacturer,    10:03:42    5    aimed at guarding against diversion.            10:03:45    6          Q.     Okay. And taking that last        10:03:46    7    category that you described with respect to     10:03:48    8    educating, I guess the public on safe           10:03:50    9    prescribing and dispensing, when did            10:03:55    10    Mallinckrodt first engage in that type of       10:03:57    11    conduct?                                       10:04:01    12          A.     I do not know the answer.          10:04:01    13          Q.     Do you generally recall if it      10:04:03    14    was after 2010?                                10:04:06    15          A.     I'm sorry, I don't know when       10:04:06    16    the group-                                   10:04:08    17          Q.     Okay.                             10:04:10    18          A.     -was created.                    10:04:10    19          Q.     And then when you described the    10:04:11    20    law enforcement activities, it seemed like to   10:04:12    21    me, and correct me if I'm wrong, that           10:04:16    22    those � you provided that type of support      10:04:21    23    when they requested it; is that fair to say?    10:04:23    24                  MR. O'CONNOR: Object to form.     10:04:27    25                  THE WITNESS: Yes.                 10:04:28    Page 71    1    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                          10:02:23    2          Q.     Sure.                            10:02:23    3                 Do you believe there's anyone      10:02:25    4    in the SOM team or anyone else in the           10:02:27    5    company, for that matter, with more knowledge   10:02:30    6    about Mallinckrodt's suspicious order          10:02:31    7    monitoring program than you?                   10:02:33    8                 MR. O'CONNOR: Object to form.     10:02:36    9                 THE WITNESS: I'll say that's      10:02:36    10          unlikely.                               10:02:37    11    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                          10:02:38    12          Q.     Okay. By the way, other than      10:02:38    13    the SOM program that you helped revise,         10:02:43    14    design and implement, were there any other      10:02:48    15    programs or systems in place at Mallinckrodt    10:02:53    16    related to diversion of controlled             10:02:57    17    substances?                                  10:03:00    18          A.     Yes.                             10:03:00    19          Q.     Okay. And what were those?        10:03:04    20          A.     So we � we work with law          10:03:05    21    enforcement and give testimony when            10:03:12    22    requested. We provide placebos for law         10:03:17    23    enforcement use on specific cases. We have a   10:03:20    24    department that educates prescribers and        10:03:25    25    patients on the proper prescribing and          10:03:30    Page 73    1    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                           10:04:30    2          Q.     Okay. So in other words, there    10:04:30    3    wasn't a program in place in which you were     10:04:32    4    regularly providing testimony, for example,     10:04:35    5    but you were � you were providing testimony    10:04:37    6    to help law enforcement when they requested     10:04:39    7    it; is that fair?                              10:04:41    8          A.     So I don't know - I may not be    10:04:42    9    aware of other people in other groups that      10:04:46    10    provided testimony, such as our research        10:04:48    11    scientists, so � but those are the times       10:04:50    12    that I am aware.                               10:04:54    13          Q.     Okay. Now, is it accurate to      10:04:55    14    say that one of the � you mentioned this a     10:04:56    15    moment ago, but I just want to make sure I      10:05:00    16    understand correctly.                          10:05:02    17                  But is it accurate to say that     10:05:03    18    one purpose of a SOM program is to identify     10:05:05    19    orders of unusual size?                        10:05:08    20          A.     Yes.                              10:05:10    21          Q.     Okay. And would it also be -     10:05:11    22    well, why is that?                             10:05:13    23          A.     It's one of the indicators that    10:05:15    24    may be � that may prompt � well, should �    10:05:23    25    will prompt additional investigation of that    10:05:26    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 19 (70 - 73)     Case: ^^-Qmt^m^t^m.#^W^<^^b 0?{&&2k$^�diSmgi$t�l@�iev,    Page 74    1    order.                                         10:05:28    2           Q.     Okay. And other than that         10:05:29    3    general concept that � in particular, the      10:05:31    4    size of an order at its most fundamental        10:05:34    5    level is important because an excessive order   10:05:37    6    or an order of � that's � that's large        10:05:42    7    could potentially be unusual; is that           10:05:47    8    correct?                                       10:05:49    9                  MR. O'CONNOR: Object to form.     10:05:49    10                  THE WITNESS: Yes, but it's all    10:05:50    11          relative to what � what is large. I     10:05:55    12           can't define large.                       10:05:58    13    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                            10:05:59    14           Q.

Would you agree with me     10:07:01    3    that an effective SOM program would be able     10:07:05    4    to identify whether a pharmacy or clinic is     10:07:08    5    ordering excessive quantities of controlled     10:07:12    6    substances?                                   10:07:15    7                  MR.

You don't believe that      10:07:18    11    would be an effective SOM program, or you       10:07:18    12    wouldn't � you don't agree with me?            10:07:21    13          A.     So would you please rephrase       10:07:23    14    the question?                                 10:07:25    15          Q.     Sure.                             10:07:26    16                 Would you agree with me that an    10:07:27    17    effective SOM program would be able to          10:07:28    18    identify whether a pharmacy or a clinic is      10:07:31    19    ordering excessive quantities of controlled     10:07:34    20    substances?                                   10:07:36    21                  MR.

So DEA tells us    10:07:52    Page 75    1    program is to identify orders that deviate      10:06:14    2    from a normal pattern; would you agree with     10:06:18    3    me?                                           10:06:19    4          A.

And it's important to       10:06:20    6    identify ordering patterns at a general         10:06:22    7    level; is that correct?                        10:06:25    8          A.

And in fact, that was       10:11:04    17    something that was important to Mallinckrodt    10:11:06    18    to try and determine at some point in the, I    10:11:08    19    believe, the 2010 or 2011 time period,          10:11:15    20    correct?                                      10:11:19    21                  MR.

And we'll get to that in a         10:09:49    3    moment, but I just have a very specific         10:09:53    4    question that I was hoping that you could       10:09:55    5    answer.                                     10:09:56    6                 Now, you agreed with me that       10:09:57    7    distributors sell downstream to pharmacies      10:10:01    8    and clinics, correct?                         10:10:03    9          A.     That's correct.                   10:10:04    10          Q.     And at some point - and I         10:10:05    11    understand your testimony that you became       10:10:06    12    aware that you had to, in your words, know      10:10:08    13    your customer, correct?                       10:10:10    14          A.

Right.                           10:10:14    17                 And then also you talked about     10:10:14    18    knowing your customer's customer as well,       10:10:16    19    correct?                                    10:10:19    20          A.

It was a guidance letter from      10:12:51    12    DEA.                                         10:12:54    13          Q.     Okay.                            10:12:54    14          A.     And it was 2006 or 2007.           10:12:54    15          Q.     Okay. So you would agree with     10:12:59    16    me then that an ineffective SOM program would   10:13:00    17    be one that just simply relies on numerical     10:13:07    18    formulas to try and understand orders that      10:13:11    19    are suspicious; is that fair to say?            10:13:14    20                 MR.

Yes.                              10:14:28    4          Q.

And I have seen some        10:15:18    22    references in the documents to a previous       10:15:20    23    order pattern consisting of anywhere from 7     10:15:22    24    to 18 months.                                  10:15:26    25                  Does that comport with your        10:15:27    Page 83    1    asking you today, as you sit here in your       10:13:22    2    position as someone that is most               10:13:25    3    knowledgeable about Mallinckrodt's SOM         10:13:28    4    program: Would you agree with me that an       10:13:31    5    ineffective SOM program would be one that       10:13:34    6    simply relies on numerical formulas to         10:13:38    7    identify suspicious orders?                   10:13:40    8                 MR.

Now, you talked a moment    10:13:49    12    ago about how there was always � as far as     10:13:51    13    you know, there was always an SOM program at    10:13:54    14    Mallinckrodt as far as � as long as you        10:13:57    15    could recall.                                10:14:01    16          A.     Yes.                            10:14:01    17          Q.     Now, from my position, looking     10:14:01    18    at the documents, the first reference I see     10:14:05    19    to an SOM program existing at Mallinckrodt is   10:14:07    20    from 2003.                                   10:14:11    21                 Is it your testimony that an       10:14:13    22    SOM program existed prior to that?             10:14:15    23          A.     Yes.                            10:14:16    24          Q.     Okay.

KO:                          10:15:37    7          Q.     Okay. But generally speaking,     10:15:37    8    what you mean when you say ""multiplier"" and     10:15:41    9    when you referenced 1.5, are you saying that    10:15:42    10    the algorithm in place before 2003 was          10:15:44    11    utilization of some multiplier relative to      10:15:50    12    the previous ordering history of a             10:15:52    13    Mallinckrodt customer? Is that accurate?       10:15:55    14          A.     Yes. Yes.                        10:15:57    15          Q.     Okay. And the customers at the    10:15:57    16    time, of course, are wholesale distributors,    10:15:59    17    right?                                       10:16:01    18          A.     I can't - we only sold to         10:16:02    19    other manufacturers from the St. Louis plant    10:16:08    20    manufacturing until we acquired our Hobart,     10:16:12    21    New York, facility, and I always forget what    10:16:16    22    year that was. I'm sorry.                     10:16:18    23          Q.     Okay. So prior to - was that     10:16:19    24    generally 2004, 2005; do you know?             10:16:21    25          A.

Okay. That's all right.           10:16:25    3    That's helpful.                                10:16:26    4                  So before acquiring the Hobart     10:16:27    5    facility, Mallinckrodt was only distributing    10:16:30    6    to other manufacturers?                        10:16:32    7          A.     Yes, and some researchers, yes.    10:16:33    8          Q.     Okay.                             10:16:37    9          A.     But not wholesalers,               10:16:37    10    distributors.                                  10:16:39    11          Q.     And these other manufacturers      10:16:39    12    included entities like Purdue?                 10:16:42    13          A.     I don't know if Purdue was a       10:16:44    14    customer, but they were dosage pharm            10:16:45    15    manufacturers who chose to buy our bulk         10:16:48    16    narcotics.                                    10:16:51    17          Q.     Right. Okay.                     10:16:52    18                  So then - thank you for           10:16:53    19    bringing up the bulk narcotics.                 10:16:55    20                  This order � excuse me. This     10:16:57    21    SOM program that you're describing, was there   10:17:03    22    an SOM program that existed both with respect   10:17:05    23    to Mallinckrodt's bulk business and its         10:17:08    24    dosage business at the time you became          10:17:14    25    involved in the DEA compliance group?           10:17:17    Page 88    1    a SOM program for anything other than the       10:18:11    2    bulk side of the business; is that accurate?    10:18:14    3                  MR.

Thank you.                        10:35:49    20          Q.     Now, at some point in time when    10:35:50    21    you were involved in the controlled substance   10:35:52    22    compliance group, did you become aware of       10:35:54    23    diversion issues in the state of Florida in     10:35:58    24    particular?                                   10:36:01    25                  MR. O'CONNOR: Object to form.     10:36:02    Page 87    1          A.     It always existed for the bulk     10:17:19    2    business, and it existed when we bought the     10:17:24    3    Hobart facility. But I'm sorry, I can't        10:17:26    4    remember what year that was relative to when    10:17:29    5    I was in the DEA compliance group, but I        10:17:31    6    believe it was during my time in the DEA        10:17:34    7    compliance group, yes.                         10:17:37    8          Q.     Okay. And then I just want to     10:17:38    9    make sure the record is clear because we're     10:17:39    10    talking about the bulk business. But when      10:17:41    11    did you became {sic} aware of an algorithm or   10:17:43    12    a suspicious order monitoring program that      10:17:45    13    applied to the dosage side of Mallinckrodt's    10:17:49    14    business?                                     10:17:55    15                  MR.

Yes.                              10:18:04    23          Q.     Okay. So prior to that time,      10:18:04    24    Mallinckrodt did not have--because they       10:18:06    25    weren't participating. But they did not have   10:18:09    Page 89    1                  THE WITNESS: Yes.                 10:36:02    2    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                           10:36:03    3          Q.     Okay. And approximately when      10:36:03    4    was that?                                     10:36:04    5          A.     I don't know the exact year.       10:36:04    6    I'm sorry.                                    10:36:10    7          Q.     Okay. And were you aware of       10:36:10    8    the problems that existed in Florida through,   10:36:13    9    among other things, communications with the     10:36:15    10    DEA?                                          10:36:17    11                  MR.

And is it fair to say       10:36:21    15    that the DEA was focused on the distribution    10:36:24    16    of Mallinckrodt oxy � oxycodone                10:36:28    17    15 milligrams and oxycodone 30 milligrams?      10:36:32    18                  MR.

I don't mind.                     10:36:48    25          Q.

Sure.                             10:37:13    16                  But you knew that � you became    10:37:13    17    aware at some point that Mallinckrodt was       10:37:16    18    sending hundreds of millions of pills to the    10:37:19    19    state of Florida, and in particular oxy 15s     10:37:22    20    and oxy 30s; is that fair to say?               10:37:25    21          A.     So we sell to wholesalers and      10:37:28    22    distributors who subsequently sell to           10:37:31    23    downstream registrants. Some of those are in   10:37:34    24    Florida, yes, but I believe we only have one    10:37:36    25    distributor actually located within the state   10:37:38    Page 92    1                  THE WITNESS: Yes.                 10:38:30    2    QUESTIONS BY MR.

And the Oxy Express is also        10:38:30    4    shorthand for the migration of pills from       10:38:32    5    Florida up north through the 1-75 corridor;     10:38:38    6    is that fair to say?                           10:38:42    7          A.     I'm not certain of the exact       10:38:42    8    road, but, yes, yes, in general.                10:38:44    9          Q.     Okay. But generally speaking,     10:38:45    10    you agree with me that the Oxy Express refers   10:38:47    11    to the migration of pills outside of the        10:38:50    12    state of Florida?                              10:38:51    13          A.     Yes.                              10:38:52    14          Q.     Okay. And these pill migrated     10:38:52    15    to other states, including, for example,        10:38:55    16    Ohio; is that correct?                         10:38:58    17                  MR.

You understood that         10:39:07    25    Mallinckrodt oxy 15s and 30s were blue,         10:39:09    Page 91    1    ofFlorida.                                   10:37:40    2          Q.     Yeah.                            10:37:40    3                 And setting aside who you          10:37:41    4    directly sold to, at some point in time you     10:37:44    5    became acutely aware of the amount of oxy 15s   10:37:47    6    and 30s that were ending up in Florida,         10:37:51    7    regardless of who you initially sold them to;   10:37:55    8    is that fair to say?                          10:37:58    9          A.     Yes.                             10:37:58    10          Q.     Okay. And you also became         10:37:59    11    aware that Mallinckrodt-manufactured generic    10:38:03    12    opioids, including oxy 15s and 30s, were        10:38:07    13    being widely abused and diverted in Florida;    10:38:10    14   is that fair to say?    10:38:16    15                 MR.

Yes.                             10:38:24    22          Q.     In fact, you gave a               10:38:24    23    presentation, I believe, at one point in time   10:38:25    24    about the Oxy Express; is that accurate?        10:38:26    25                 MR. O'CONNOR: Object to form.     10:38:29    Page 93 correct?                                        10:39:13    A.     Oh, yes. Yes.                     10:39:13    Q. Okay. And you understood that 10:39:14 a distinct feature of these oxy 15s and 30s 10:39:15 and � were � was the fact that they were 10:39:20 blue, and they were one of the only             10:39:22    7    prescription opioids on the market that were    10:39:24    8    that color.                                     10:39:25 MR.

Do you understand that to be       10:39:28 the case?                                       10:39:29    A.     So I know that oxy 30s are         10:39:29    15    blue. I'm not certain if oxy 15s are blue or   10:39:32    16    not, sir, I'm sorry. They may be a different   10:39:35    17    color.                                          10:39:38 Q.     Okay.

Yes.                               10:39:43    Q.     Those pills were blue, and you     10:39:44 understood that those pills were migrating      10:39:47    24    north away from Florida; is that fair to say?   10:39:49    25                  MR.

We'll get to this a         10:39:53    5    little bit later, but about a year and a half   10:40:02    6    ago you obviously became aware of a             10:40:06    7    settlement between Mallinckrodt and DOJ; is     10:40:07    8    that correct?                                 10:40:11    9          A.     Yes.                              10:40:11    10          Q.     And the settlement was with        10:40:12    11    respect to Mallinc � among other things,       10:40:13    12    Mallinckrodt's conduct with respect to          10:40:16    13    suspicious order monitoring of controlled       10:40:21    14    substances, correct?                           10:40:23    15          A.     Yes.                              10:40:24    16          Q.     Okay. And the settlement          10:40:27    17    resulted in a $35 million payment by your       10:40:32    18    employer to the government, correct?            10:40:34    19          A.     Yes.                              10:40:36    20          Q.     Okay. And given that the          10:40:38    21    settlement revolved largely around              10:40:40    22    Mallinckrodt's suspicious order monitoring      10:40:44    23    activities � I mean, that was something that   10:40:48    24    was your responsibility during the relevant     10:40:52    25    time period covered under the settlement; is    10:40:55    Page 96    1          A.     Yes.                              10:41:28    2          Q.     Okay. And I understand the        10:41:29    3    settlement includes a period described          10:41:33    4    ""covered conduct.""                             10:41:37    5                  Do you recall that provision of    10:41:37    6    the settlement agreement?                      10:41:39    7          A.     Yes.                              10:41:40    8          Q.     And the time period for that       10:41:40    9    covered conduct was from January 1, 2008, to    10:41:42    10    January 1, 2012.                               10:41:47    11                  Is that consistent with your       10:41:48    12    understanding?                                10:41:49    13          A.     I don't remember the specific      10:41:50    14    times of the covered conduct, but �            10:41:52    15          Q.     Okay.                             10:41:52    16          A.     I don't. I'm sorry.               10:41:54    17          Q.     All right. That's fine. We       10:41:56    18    can get to that later.                         10:41:56    19          A.     Okay.                             10:41:57    20          Q.     But in general terms, there was    10:41:57    21    a period of time in which the government        10:41:59    22    alleged that Mallinckrodt had a deficient SOM   10:42:01    23    program; is that fair to say?                  10:42:04    24          A.     I don't know that the term         10:42:06    25    ""deficient"" was used.                          10:42:07    Page 95 i   that correct?                                   10:40:57    2                  MR.

And the relevant time       10:41:00    7    period of the settlement, I believe, or the     10:41:02    8    covered conduct as described in the             10:41:04 settlement � actually, strike that.            10:41:07    Are you familiar with the terms    10:41:09    17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25    of the settlement?

Q.     Okay. That was presumably done    10:41:18    by counsel?                                     10:41:21    A.     Yes.                               10:41:21    Q.

Yeah.                            10:42:13    5                 That Mallinckrodt's SOM - the     10:42:14    6    settlement agreement indicated that            10:42:16    7    Mallinckrodt's SOM program did not comport      10:42:19    8    with the DEA guidelines set forth in a couple   10:42:22    9    letters sent by the DEA; is that correct?       10:42:27    10                 MR.

So they were the eyes and ears     10:45:19    21    to our customers, but I do not necessarily      10:45:21    22    know that they were the eyes and ears to our    10:45:23    23    customers' customers.                         10:45:28    24          Q.

Uh-huh.                          10:44:39    20          Q.     And by CSC, I'm referring to       10:44:39    21    the controlled substance compliance group.      10:44:41    22    Is that fair to say?                          10:44:43    23          A.

And you - is it fair to    10:45:42    10    say that you then relied on these NAMs and      10:45:47    11    CSRs to identify and assist with the            10:45:49    12    detection of suspicious orders?                10:45:53    13                 MR.

KO:                          10:46:05    18          Q.     And you said earlier that you      10:46:05    19    had a team, and they were part of it, so they   10:46:06 2 0    were � they were part of the team in          10:46:08    21    which - they were part of the SOM team,        10:46:12    22    correct?                                     10:46:14    23                 MR. O'CONNOR: Object to form.     10:46:15    24                 THE WITNESS: They were part of    10:46:15    25          the SOM team at the time that we were     10:46:18    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 26 (98 - 101)     Case: ^^-Qmt^m^t^m.#^W^<^^b 0?{&&2^^�diSmgi$t�189fo.ev,    Page 102    1          enhancing the program but not as an       10:46:20    2          ongoing, current-day member of the        10:46:23    3          team.                                   10:46:25    4    QUESTIONS BY MR.

Got it.                          10:46:27    6                 And when did that occur, that      10:46:27    7    they were...                                  10:46:30    8                 Well, when you said they were      10:46:31    9    part of the SOM team at that time, what time    10:46:39    10    period are you talking about?                  10:46:41    11          A.     So we went through several         10:46:42    12    projects of enhancing the suspicious order      10:46:50    13    monitoring program, and one of the components   10:46:53    14    was a customer checklist that each customer     10:46:55    15    was to fill out once per year.                 10:46:58    16                 So the NAMs and the customer       10:47:01    17    service reps were important contributors to     10:47:04    18    that effort because they knew more about the    10:47:06    19    customer side of the house, but as we sit       10:47:10 2 0    here today, they are not part of the            10:47:13    21    suspicious order monitoring team.              10:47:15    22          Q.     Got it. Thank you for the         10:47:16    23    clarification.                                10:47:17    24                 So at some point in time when      10:47:17    25    you were part of the CSC team, the             10:47:24    1          for additional investigation.    2    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:    3          Q.     Okay.    Page 104 10:48:17    10:48:17 10:48:19    4          A.     Not necessarily conclusion         10:48:19    5    diversion.                                   10:48:21    6          Q.     Okay. That's helpful.             10:48:22    7                 And with regard to the SOM         10:48:24    8    program, the NAMs � so then it's fair to say   10:48:26    9    that the NAMs'and the CSRs'job was to alert   10:48:28    10    you to � alert you to potential diversion;     10:48:32    11    is that accurate?                             10:48:34    12          A.     Yes, I believe the structure       10:48:35    13    for customer service was they would escalate    10:48:36    14    to their manager first, who would then, if      10:48:39    15    appropriate, come to the controlled            10:48:41    16    substances compliance group with that           10:48:43    17    concern.                                     10:48:44    18          Q.     Okay. So if a-if an           10:48:45    19    individual who was a national account manager   10:48:48    20    or customer service representative testified    10:48:50    21    that she or he was not involved in             10:48:54    22    identifying suspicious orders, that would not   10:48:57    23    be accurate, correct?                         10:48:59    24                 MR. O'CONNOR: Objection to        10:49:00    25          form.                                   10:49:01    Page 103    1    involvement of the NAMs and the customer        10:47:27    2    service reps in the day-to-day monitoring of    10:47:29    3    the customers was removed off their plate; is   10:47:34    4    that fair to say?                              10:47:38    5                  MR. O'CONNOR: Object to form.     10:47:38    6                  THE WITNESS: So I would have      10:47:41    7          never called the NAMs a day-to-day        10:47:41    8          monitoring. The customer service         10:47:44    9          reps, yes, as they reviewed orders        10:47:46    10          that came in, that has not changed.       10:47:48    11           So I'd like to clarify that point.        10:47:49    12                  But when we speak of the           10:47:51    13           suspicious order monitoring team, the     10:47:53    14          commercial � neither the commercial      10:47:56    15          group nor customer service is             10:47:57    16          currently on the team.                   10:47:59    17    QUESTIONS BY MR.

So when they were part      10:48:00    19    of the team, the NAMs and the CSRs assisted     10:48:02    20    in rooting out potential diversion of           10:48:06    21    Mallinckrodt controlled substances; is that     10:48:10    22    accurate?                                     10:48:12    23                  MR.

Now, throughout the time    10:49:15    5    you were involved with the CSC and in          10:49:18    6    connection with your duties to revise the SOM   10:49:20    7    program, did you ever consult any third        10:49:25    8    parties or consultants to assist you in        10:49:28    9    implementing and maintaining an SOM program?    10:49:33    10          A.     Yes.                            10:49:36    11          Q.     Okay. And which third parties     10:49:37    12    or vendors would those be?                    10:49:38    13          A.     The company is Drug and           10:49:39    14    Chemical Advisory Group. I'm not certain if    10:49:47    15    they still exist, but that was the firm at      10:49:48    16    the time. And that group was made up of        10:49:55    17    former DEA executives.                       10:49:58    18          Q.     Okay. Including Frank            10:49:59    19    Sapienza?                                   10:50:02    20          A.     Sapienza, yes, sir.               10:50:02    21          Q.     Other than the drug and           10:50:04    22    chemical group, anyone else?                  10:50:05    23          A.     Yes.                            10:50:06    24          Q.     Who or which entities?            10:50:06    25          A.     A gentleman, Howard Davis. He     10:50:09    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 27 (102 - 105)     Case: ^^-Qmt^m^t^m.#^W^<^^b Pr7(^^^^r^�dJ^m#b^i^Lew    Page 106    1    was retired DEA diversion program manager.      10:50:13    2          Q.     Okay. Other than the drug and     10:50:20    3    chemical group and Mr. Davis, did you retain    10:50:21    4    any other entities to assist in the            10:50:25    5    implementation of Mallinckrodt's SOM program?   10:50:28    6          A.     Is there a specific time frame     10:50:30    7    to which you refer?                           10:50:34    8          Q.     During the time period in which    10:50:35    9    you were senior manager of the controlled       10:50:37    10    substance compliance group.                    10:50:40    11          A.     Yes.                            10:50:41    12          Q.     Okay. And who would - who        10:50:44    13    would that individual be or which entities      10:50:45    14    would that be?                               10:50:47    15          A.     So I get - I get confused         10:50:48    16    because we did not retain the consulting        10:50:50    17    group for this purpose. They were retained     10:50:55    18    through outside counsel, so Mallinckrodt did    10:50:58    19    not retain them.                             10:51:01    20          Q.     I see.                           10:51:02    21                 So outside counsel, do you mean    10:51:03    22    Ropes & Gray?                                10:51:05    23          A.     Yes.                            10:51:05    24          Q.     Okay. And which third-party       10:51:06    25    consultant or vendor are you referring to?      10:51:11    Page 108    1    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                          10:52:19    2          Q.     Okay. Other than the Buzzeo       10:52:19    3    group, the drug and chemical group and          10:52:25    4    Mr. Howard Davis, do you recall any other       10:52:27    5    entities or individuals that Mallinckrodt       10:52:29    6    retained for purposes of implementing its SOM   10:52:31    7    program at the time you were senior manager?    10:52:34    8          A.     Yes.                             10:52:36    9          Q.     Okay. Who else?                  10:52:37    10          A.     So there's - there is a lady      10:52:39    11    who was a former employee. Her name is         10:52:41    12    Jennifer, but she goes by Jen, Buist,           10:52:45    13    B-u-i-s-t.                                    10:52:51    14          Q.     And if memory serves me            10:52:51    15    correct, Ms. � or Jennifer was retained        10:52:55    16    sometime after 2012.                          10:52:58    17                 Is that consistent with your       10:53:02    18    understanding?                                10:53:02    19          A.     Yes.                             10:53:02    20          Q.     Okay. In other words, she         10:53:06    21    wasn't retained � or she wasn't part of the    10:53:08    22    SOM team in the 2008 to 2012 time period, was   10:53:10    23    she?                                         10:53:12    24          A.     No.                              10:53:13    25                 (Mallinckrodt-Harper Exhibit 2     10:53:13    Page 107    1          A.     They've changed names              10:51:12    2    throughout the years. It was at one time       10:51:14    3    called Buzzeo Consulting. Their named          10:51:16    4    changed to IQVIA, Quintiles IMS, and now        10:51:20    5    they're known only at IMS.                     10:51:27    6          Q.     And my understanding of IMS        10:51:31    7    is - and IQVIA is that it's a database that    10:51:32    8    tracks detailed patient-level information.      10:51:36    9    So I just want to make sure I understand what   10:51:39    10    you're referring to in terms of their           10:51:41    11    retention.                                    10:51:44    12                  Is it your testimony that you      10:51:45    13    believe that they actually testified as         10:51:47    14    consultants for the company, or did you         10:51:51    15    simply acquire data from them?                 10:51:53    16                 MR.

I want to turn to           10:57:04    25    page 11 of this document, of the deck in        10:57:12    Page 111    1          A.     I see that.                       10:55:18    2          Q.     Okay. And that the name was       10:55:19    3    changed from DEA compliance to the CSC,         10:55:21    4    correct?                                     10:55:29    5          A.     Yes. Yes.                        10:55:29    6          Q.     Okay. And just to help you        10:55:29    7    along, the portion I was referencing just a     10:55:35    8    moment ago was right there.                    10:55:43    9                 And so the CSC group of which      10:55:44    10    you were senior manager was established in      10:55:47    11    August 2008, according to this presentation,    10:55:49    12    correct?                                     10:55:51    13          A.

And is that consistent with        10:55:54    16    your recollection?                            10:55:57    17          A.     I'm so uncertain of the years      10:55:58    18    the different events happened. I know this     10:56:01    19    happened. I see that the presentation reads    10:56:03 2 0    that way, but if it conflicts with a date       10:56:05    21    that I previously provided, I apologize.        10:56:08    22          Q.     Sure. No need to apologize.       10:56:12    23    This isn't necessarily a memory test.           10:56:15    24          A.     Okay.                            10:56:17    25          Q.

Yes, I do.                         10:57:22    5           Q.     And it indicates here that you     10:57:24    6    are the manager, as we just discussed, of       10:57:26    7    controlled substance compliance, correct?       10:57:28    8           A.

Okay.                             10:58:09    4          A.

No.                               10:58:41    14          Q.     It's not.                         10:58:41    15                  You don't believe you were the     10:58:42    16    team leader of � during -- well, let me take   10:58:43    17    that back.                                    10:58:47    18                  So from the time period of         10:58:47    19    August 2008 to 2012, were you the team leader   10:58:50    20    of Mallinckrodt's SOM program?                 10:58:57    21          A.     We did not have a designated       10:59:00    22    team leader.                                   10:59:02    23          Q.     Okay.                             10:59:03    24          A.     And we would have deferred to      10:59:04    25    the most senior official on the team, but we    10:59:06    Page 116    1    before, it's highly unlikely that anyone else   10:59:47    2    at Mallinckrodt knew more about                10:59:49    3    Mallinckrodt's SOM program other than you,      10:59:52    4    correct?                                      10:59:54    5          A.     Correct.                          10:59:54    6          Q.     Okay. And in addition to you      10:59:55    7    having involvement in the SOM program at        11:00:02    8    Mallinckrodt, Ms. Spaulding also played a key   11:00:03    9    role; would you agree with that?                11:00:06    10                  MR.

Okay.                             10:59:23 Q.     So if your recollection is         10:59:23    different, I totally understand.                10:59:25    But I have seen reference to       10:59:27 documents that suggest that you were the team   10:59:28 leader of the SOM program.                     10:59:30    Do you - you dispute that?        10:59:32 MR.

I may have been referenced as      10:59:38 the team leader, but I didn't � I was a key    10:59:40 contributor, but I didn't perceive myself as    10:59:43 the leader.                                   10:59:46    Q.

I want to turn to the next         11:12:57    21    exhibit, which will be marked as Harper         11:13:03    22    Exhibit 3.                                     11:13:05    2 3                For the record, this is ending     11:13:11    24    in Bates stamp 283074.                          11:13:13    25                  And it is an e-mail dated          11:13:24    Page 132    1    presentation, but the e-mail indicates it was   11: 14:20    2    provided to Michael Santowski for training of   11: 14:24    3    the executive committee. So that was a level   11:14:28    4    I didn't--that was senior executives within   11:14:31    5    the organization.                              11:14:32    6          Q.     I see. That's very helpful.       11:14:33    7                  So you didn't actual present       11:14:35    8    this deck to the executive committee?           11: 14:37    9          A.I have a number of slides that     11:14:38    10    I pull in and out of presentations as           11:14:42    11    appropriate for the audience. So I'm certain   11:14:44    12    I presented variations of these slides to       11:14:47    13    different audiences, but I did not present      11:14:50    14    this deck to the executive committee.           11:14:52    15          Q.     Okay. That's helpful.             11:14:55    16                  But you created the deck for       11:14:56    17    Mr. Santowski, if I understand correctly?       11:14:58    18          A.

And here we have some of the     11:15:07    21    regulations that interpret the CSA.             11:15:19    22                  Do you see that?                   11:15:21    23          A.     I think that's verbatim, but,      11:15:22    24    yes, yes. Not an interpretation, but the       11:15:29    25    statements in the Code of Federal               11:15:32    Page 131    1    April 12, 2011, from you to Michael            11:13: 26    2    Santowski.                                    11:13:31    3                 Who is Michael Santowski?          11:13:32    4          A.

We reported to him, so he had      11:13:44    10    oversight for several groups, including ours,   11:13:49    11    yes.                                         11:13:52    12          Q.     I see.                           11:13:52    13                 And now it appears that you've     11:13:53    14    become the senior manager of the controlled     11:13: 54    15    substance compliance group.                    11:13:56    16                 Do you see that?                  11:13:57    17          A.     Yes.                             11:13:57    18          Q.     So at least as of April 12,        11:13:58    19    2011, you were the senior manager of the CSC?   11:14:00    20          A.     I agree.                         11:14:04    21          Q.     Okay.

So clearly I created the           11:14:14    Page 133    1    Regulations.                                     11:15:35    2           Q.     Okay. Great.

Some of the statements, I        11:16:53    21          believe, particularly the italicized      11:16:55    22           one at the bottom, may have been          11:16:58    23           culled from a DEA - one of the DEA       11:17:01    24           guidance letters.                         11:17:04    25    Page 136    1    have any recollection?                         11:17:48    2                  MR.

But regardless of where     11:17:05    3    it came from, at least at the time of this      11:17:08    4    presentation, you believe that Mallinckrodt     11:17:10    5    had a duty to ensure that their suspicious      11:17:12    6    order responsibilities did not end merely       11:17:17    7    with the filing of a suspicious order report;   11:17:18    8    is that correct?                              11:17:21    9                 MR.

And when did you            11:17:43    25    understand DEA to tell you that first; do you   11:17:45    CSA; is that correct?    A.     As of that time, yes. Q.     Right, as of that time. A.     Yes.    Page 137 11:18:44 11:18:45 11:18:48 11:18:49    Q.     And there's a specific quote       11:18:49 that you include in this presentation that      11:18:51    7    says that ""the DEA must rely on the states      11:18:53    8    and individual registrants to monitor.""          11:18:56    9                  Do you see that?                   11:18:58 io         A.     I do see that.                     11:18:58    11           Q.     And the ""individual                11:18:59    12    registrants"" obviously refers to entities       11:19:00    13    like Mallinckrodt?                              11:19:03    14           A.     Correct.                           11:19:04    15           Q.     And so at least as of this         11:19:05    16    time, the date of this deck, you understood     11: 19:07    17    that the DEA was not going to give you          11:19:10    18    specific guidance but was going to rely on      11:19:11    19    registrants like Mallinckrodt to monitor        11:19:16 2 o    their controlled substances, correct?           11:19:18    21                  MR.

I do.                             11:20:13    20           Q.     So you were aware at the time      11:20:13    21    of this presentation that there was a --        11:20:16    22    almost all of the � or the top doctors         11:20:20    23    dispensing oxycodone were in Florida,           11:20:23    24    correct?                                       11:20:25    25                  MR.

Well, let's talk about that        11:21:36    18    then. The next--the previous page,           11:21:40    19    actually, page 6, there's a description of      11:21:42    2 0    oxycodone market share of Mallinckrodt          11:21:45    21    relative to the rest of your competitors.       11:21:47    22                  Do you see that?                   11:21:50    23          A.     I do see it.                       11:21:51    24          Q.     So at least as of Q4 of 2010,      11:21:53    25    it appears that Mallinckrodt has a 52 percent   11:21:59    Page 139    1          form.                                   11:20:27    2                 THE WITNESS: Yes.

Yes, I do see that statistic,      11:22:23    11    yes.                                          11:22:26    12          Q.     All right. And so there - and    11:22:26    13    none of Mallinckrodt's competitors are          11:22:27    14    anywhere close to Mallinckrodt's market share   11:22:29    15    based on this table, correct?                  11:22:32    16          A.

And in fact, as we just            11:22:35    18    previously described and went over, the total   11:22:37    19    percentage of Mallinckrodt's competitors is     11:22:41    20    less than Mallinckrodt's own share of the       11:22:44    21    market of oxycodone, correct?                  11:22:47    22                  MR.

I do.                             11:23:50    Page 144    1    expected Mallinckrodt to understand and know    11:24:43    2    their customer's customer; is that correct?     11:24:47    3                 MR.

KO:                          11:24:54    8          Q.     Okay. So as of July 20th - no    11:24:54    9    later than July 20, 2010, you understood that   11:24:56    10    Mallinckrodt had an obligation as required by   11:25:00    11    the DEA to know their customer's customer,      11:25:02    12    correct?                                     11:25:05    13                 MR.

KO:                          11:25:12    19          Q.     Okay. And we'll get to that       11:25:12    2 0    maybe in a moment, but � well, first of all,   11: 25:13    21    is there any indication of a contradiction on   11:25:17    22    this deck?                                   11:25:19    23          A.     Well, so the DEA expectation,      11: 25:19    24    I'm using that term as all of DEA here when I   11:25:24    25    prepared the bullet point on the slide, but     11:25:28    Page 143    1          Q.     And that was something that the    11:23:50    2    DEA had indicated to you?                      11:23:52    3          A.     Yes.                              11:23:53    4          Q.     Okay. And my presumption is       11:23:55    5    that they expressed that view because           11:23:57    6    Mallinckrodt had the majority of the market     11:23:59    7    share of oxycodone?                            11:24:02    8                  MR.

KO:                           11:24:12    15          Q.     Okay. So you - regardless,       11:24:12    16    you recall during this DEA meeting in July      11:24:16    17    of 2010 that DEA had expressed the view that    11:24:20    18    Mallinckrodt was viewed as the kingpin within   11:24:22    19    the drug cartel?                               11:24:24    20          A.     I do.                             11:24:25    21          Q.     Okay. And we had discussed a      11:24:26 2 2    little time ago that - about Mallinckrodt's    11:24:31    23    duties to know their customers'customers,      11:24:34    24    and here you indicate that at least as of the   11:24:36    25    date of this meeting, you understood that DEA   11:24:38    Page 145    1    the comment came from DEA St. Louis.            11:25:31    2          Q.     Okay. So when you say that you    11:25:33    3    are referring to DEA � the DEA expectation,    11:25:34    4    then it is fair to say that based on your       11:25:39    5    conversation with the DEA on July 20th, you     11:25:41    6    understood that Mallinckrodt had an             11:25:43    7    obligation to know your customer's customer;    11:25:46    8    is that correct?                               11:25:50    9                 MR.

By the way, we talked       11:26:17    5    about Mr. Ratliff a moment ago.                 11:26:31    6                 When did you first start           11:26:34    7    working with Mr. Ratliff?                      11:26:35    8          A.

I don't know when he came to       11:26:41    12    us, I'm sorry.                                 11:26:45    13          Q.     Sure.                             11:26:46    14                  Do you know who Pete Kleissle      11:26:47    15    is?                                           11:26:51    16          A.     Yes.                              11:26:51    17          Q.     He was at DEA, correct?            11:26:52    18          A.     Yes.                              11:26:53    19          Q.     Do you recall any conversations    11:26:53    2 0    with Pete Kleissle regarding your obligations   11:26:55    21    to know your customer's customer?               11:26:59    22          A.     So when I'm using the term         11:27:01    23    ""DEA"" here, this conversation was indeed with   11:27:06    24    Pete Kleissle.                                 11:27:10    25          Q.     Okay. So Pete Kleissle            11:27:11    Page 148    1    I may have carried this information back to     11:28:05    2    the suspicious order monitoring team at the     11:28:08    3    time.                                          11:28:10    4          Q.     Okay. I want to turn back to      11:28:10    5    the table of contents of this deck, which       11:28:26    6    appears on page 2.

Including some of the things       11:28:50    12    that we went over and also this reference to    11:28:52    13    an OxyContin Express video?                     11:28:55    14          A.     Yes.                              11:28:58    15          Q.     And do you recall ever             11:28:59    16    presenting � I know you didn't make this       11:29:01    17    presentation, but did you recall presenting     11:29:04    18    about the OxyContin Express in other settings   11:29:07    19    at Mallinckrodt?                               11:29:13    20          A.     Yes, I believe so.                 11:29:13    21          Q.     Okay. And that video, again,      11:29:13    22    consisted of your understanding of migration    11:29:15    23    of opioid pills moving north from Florida,      11:29:17    24    correct?                                       11:29:20    25          A.     Correct.                           11:29:21    Page 147    1    specifically told you and other people that     11:27:15    2    were at this meeting that you had an            11:27:18    3    obligation to know your customer's customer     11:27:20    4    or-                                         11:27:23    5          A.     It was only me.                   11:27:23    6          Q.     Only you. Okay.                  11:27:24    7                  And who did you share that         11:27:27    8    information with?                              11:27:28    9          A.     The person to whom I reported      11:27:28    10    at the time and Bill Ratliff, because I don't   11:27:35    11    believe our group reported to him, but we       11:27:38    12    work in close conjunction with the security     11:27:39    13    group in DEA compliance.                       11:27:41    14          Q.     Okay. And so the person you       11:27:42    15    reported to at the time was Ms. Levy or was     11:27:44    16    it Mr. Santowski? You don't recall?            11:27:46    17          A.     It was another person, Tom         11:27:48    18    Berry.                                        11:27:52    19          Q.     Tom Berry. Okay.                  11:27:52    20                  So other than Mr. Berry and        11:27:52    21    Mr. Ratliff, did you talk about this            11:27:54    22    conversation you had with Mr. Kleissle with     11:27:56    23    anyone else?                                  11:27:58    24          A.     I may have discussed it -         11:27:59    25    well, clearly I put it in a presentation, so    11:28:04    Page 149    1           Q.     And unfortunately we don't have    11:29:22    2    the video to play, but I believe �              11:29:27    3           A.     Unfortunately, a lot of the        11:29:28    4    time I couldn't get the video to play.           11:29:31    5           Q.     Oh, okay.                           11:29:32    6                  Well, I believe there's some       11:29:33    7    stills, at least, in this presentation.          11:29:34    8    Turning to page 16.                              11:29:36    9           A.     All right.                          11:29:37    io          Q.     Do you recall that particular      11:29:47    11    image?                                           11:29:48    12           A.     I do.                               11:29:48    13           Q.     This was an image that was          11:29:49    14    included in your video?                          11:29:50    15           A.     I don't think so. I think it      11:29:51    16    was separate.                                    11:29:54    17           Q.     This is just an image?              11:29:55    18           A.     Yes.                                11:29:56    19           Q.     Okay. This was an image of, I     11:29:57    20    think, a pill mill in Florida?                   11:29:59    21                   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection to        11:30:01    22           form.                                      11:30:01    23                   THE WITNESS: Yes.                  11:30:01    24    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                             11:30:02    25           Q.     And the pill mill was, I            11:30:02    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 38 (146 - 149)     Case: ^TT^-WR^^^tR^#^^3i^kB^o o?{&&�0&^�diSmgi&�W4iev,    Page 150    1    think --1 think this particular picture was    11:30:04    2    of Tru-Valu, I believe.                         11:30:06    3                  Does that name ring a bell?        11:30:08    4                  MR. O'CONNOR: Objection to        11:30:12    5           form.                                    11:30:12    6                  THE WITNESS: The name rings a     11:30:12    7          bell, but I don't have a way of           11:30:13    8           identifying the pharmacy here.            11:30:14    9    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                            11:30:16    10           Q.     Okay. By the way, what's your     11:30:16    11    definition of a pill mill?                      11:30:17    12           A.     The definition of a pill mill,     11:30:18    13    from my perspective, is a facility wherein      11:30:20    14    patients who may not legitimately have the      11:30:28    15    need for a prescription would go and have �    11:30:33    16    some doctors were overprescribing or selling    11:30:38    17    oxycodone specifically within the state of      11:30:43    18    Florida because it was a DEA-registered         11: 30:45    19    activity at the time.                           11:30:47    20           Q.     And then, therefore, as a          11:30:48    21    result of the wide � or overprescription of    11:30:51    22    oxycodone, those particular prescription        11:30:53    23    opioids were being widely abused and            11:30:56    24    diverted; is that correct?                      11:30:59    25                  MR. O'CONNOR: Objection to        11:30:59    Page 152    1    as Harper Exhibit 4. For the record, that'll   11:31:52    2    end in Bates stamp 496098.                     11:31:58    3                 Actually, we'll skip that one.     11:32:18    4    Let's go to - I'll take that one. Still       11:32:23    5    Exhibit 4. Strike that.                       11:32:32    6                 Exhibit 4 is actually ending in    11: 32:34    7    Bates stamp 1308810. That is Harper           11:32:36    8    Exhibit 4.                                   11:32:44    9                 You keep that one. That's the     11:32:44    10    official copy with the -                      11: 32:46    11          A.     Okay. I apologize. Sorry.        11:32:48    12          Q.     No need to apologize.             11:32:49    13                 For the record, this is a          11:32:50    14    March 3, 2008 e-mail from you to Bill           11:33:02    15    Ratliff.                                     11:33:05    16                 Do you see that?                  11:33:06    17          A.     I do.                            11:33:06    18          Q.     Do you have any reason to doubt    11:3 3: 06    19    that you sent this e-mail to Mr. Ratliff on     11:33:08    11:33:11    A.     No reason to doubt it.             11:33:11    Q.     Okay. So I know you said a        11:33:13    23    moment ago you don't recall when you started    11:33:14    2 4    working with Mr. Ratliff, but at least as of    11:33:16    25    March of 2008, you seemed to be working with    11:33:18    20   March 3, 2008?    21 22    Page 151    1          form.                                   11:31:00    2                  THE WITNESS: So, yes,             11:31:00    3          that's - that's one of the               11:31:02    4          contributing factors, yes.                11:31:03    5    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                           11:31:05    6          Q.     Okay. And you understood          11:31:05    7    during the 2008 through 2012 time period that   11:31:07    8    there were a large amount of pill mills in      11:31:10    9    Florida, correct?                              11:31:13    10          A.     I don't know the number, and I     11:31:14    11    don't have a � a basis for correlation in      11:31:16    12    terms of large � I'm sorry, I can't answer     11:31:18    13    the question.                                  11:31:21    14          Q.     Relative to any other states       11:31:22    15    that you were looking at during your time as    11:31:25    16    senior manager of controlled substance          11:31:26    17    compliance, do you recall any other state in    11:31:28    18    which you've examined pill mill activities      11:31:32    19    other than Florida?                            11:31: 34    20          A.     No, the focus was Florida.         11:31:36    21                  (Mallinckrodt-Harper Exhibit 4     11:31:54    22          marked for identification.)               11:31:54    23    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                           11:31:40    24          Q.     Okay. Okay. We can set this      11:31:40    25    aside. Right now turn to what will be marked   11:31:49    Page 153    1    him in connection with DEA compliance,          11:33:20    2    correct?                                      11:33:24    3          A.     Correct.                          11:33:24    4          Q.     And it appears that you're         11:33:24    5    preparing some DEA compliance monthly           11:33:25    6    highlights as of February 2008.                 11:33:30    7                  Do you see that?                  11:33:32    8          A.     Yes.                              11:33:32    9          Q.     And do you recall how              11:33:33    10    frequently you prepared these monthly           11:33:35    11    highlights?                                   11:33:37    12          A.     I believe it was monthly.          11:33:38    13          Q.     And do you recall when you         11:33:39    14    first started preparing these ?                 11:3 3:40    15          A.     I do not.                         11:33:42    16          Q.     And here the distribution is to    11:33:44    17   Mr. Ratliff.    11:33:47    18                  Do you recall ever sending         11:33:48    19    these DEA compliance monthly highlights to      11:33:50    20    anyone else?                                  11:33:55    21          A.     They would have been sent to       11:33:55    22    the person to whom I reported, so it was Bill   11:33:57    23    Ratliff at the time. So there would have       11:33:59    24    been other people as � as my manager changed   11:34:00    25    overtime.                                    11:34:03    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 39 (150 - 153)     Case: ^TT^-WR^^^tR^#^^3i^kB^o 0?{&&�k$^�diSmgi&�W$iev,    Page 154    1          Q.     I see.                           11:34:04    2                 So you sent � during the time     11:34:04    3    period in which you created a DEA compliance    11:34:07    4    monthly highlight, you sent those to your       11:34:10    5    direct report each month, correct?             11:34:12    6          A.     The person to whom I reported,     11: 34:14    7    yes.                                         11:34:16    8          Q.     Okay.                            11:34:16    9          A.     And I can't rule out no one        11:34:16    10    else received this, but this is directed to     11:34:19    11    Bill Ratliff only on the correspondence.        11:34:22    12          Q.     And as a general matter, these     11:34:24    13    monthly highlights were sent only to your       11:34:26    14    direct report; is that fair to say?            11:34:29    15          A.     The person to whom I reported      11: 34:31    16    directly, yes.                                11:34:33    17          Q.     Okay. Thank you.                 11:34:33    18                 And I just want to go over one     11:34:34    19    quick thing on this particular e-mail.          11:34:38    20                 Do you see three sections down     11:34:42    21    the portion of the e-mail that refers to        11: 34:46    22    suspicious order monitoring?                   11:34:48    23          A.     Yes, I see it.                    11:34:49    24          Q.     You indicate to Mr. Ratliff        11:34:51    25    that ""the need for a comprehensive review and   11:34:55    Page 156    1    that Mallinckrodt's SOM program needed to       11:36:02    2    be � needed to receive elevated priority?      11:36:04    3          A.     I do.                             11:36:08    4          Q.     Yeah. And what were the           11:36:09    5    reasons for that?                              11:36:11    6          A.     So this master compounding         11:36:12    7    pharmacy sale, which we did not make, the       11:36:15    8    matter was brought to our attention by a DEA    11:36:20    9    investigator. But after the decision was       11:36:23    10    made that that was a suspicious order we        11:36:26    11    would not ship, one of the narcotic � the      11:36:28    12    NAMs - but she was on the bulk side. She      11:36:31    13    said to us, ""Ah, I was in that place, and it    11:36:34    14    didn't look right.""                            11:36:37    15                  So that prompted a reeducation     11:36:38    16    of the commercial group, our eyes and ears in   11:36:41    17    the market again, to call to our attention      11:36:45    18    anything that looked abnormal with any of the   11:36:47    19    facilities to which we were selling.            11:36:50    20          Q.     Okay. And during this time        11:36:52    21    period � we had talked a moment ago about      11:36:54    22    certain DEA guidance letters that you had       11:36:56    23    received in 2006 through 2007 time period,      11:36:59    24    correct?                                      11:37:01    25          A.     Yes.                              11:37:01    Page 155    1    upgrade of our suspicious order monitoring      11:34:58    2    program has received elevated priority.""        11:34:59    3                  Did I read that correctly?         11:35:02    4          A.     Yes.                              11:35:03    5          Q.     So is it fair to say that as of    11:35:05    6    March of 2008, your belief was that             11:35:08    7    Mallinckrodt's SOM program needed to be         11:35:12    8    reviewed and upgraded and that � needed to     11:35:15    9    be reviewed and upgraded?                      11:35:19    10                  MR. O'CONNOR: Objection to        11:35:20    11          form.                                   11:35:20    12                  TIJE WITNESS: It states - yes,    11:35:20    13          it states ""upgraded."" I would have       11:35:22    14          changed that terminology if I could,      11:35:24    15          but it says ""upgraded,"" yes.              11:35:26    16    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                           11:35:27    17          Q.     Okay. And you also state that     11:35:28    18    ""as of March 3, 2008, the need to review and    11:35:31    19    upgrade Mallinckrodt's SOM program is an        11:35:36    20    elevated priority""; is that correct?            11:35:40    21          A.     Yes.                              11:35:42    22          Q.     Okay. You can set that aside.     11:35:42    23                  Do you recall � you can refer     11:35:54    24    back to that document if you like, but do you   11:35:55    25    recall why you felt at that particular time     11:35:58    Page 157    1          Q.     And those letters were sent by     11:37:01    2    Joseph Rannazzisi, correct?                    11:37:04    3          A.     I believe, yes. Yes, he was       11:37:05    4    deputy assistant administrator. Yes.           11:37:08    5          Q.     And is it okay for purposes of     11:37:13    6    this deposition to refer to those guidance      11:37:16    7    letters as the Rannazzisi letters?              11:37:17    8          A.     Yes.                              11:37:19    9          Q.     Okay. So was one of the           11:37:19    10    reasons why you were putting more attention     11:37:20    11    to Mallinckrodt's SOM program a result of       11:37:25    12    receiving these � of receiving the             11:37:28    13    Rannazzisi letters?                            11:37:30    14          A.     It caused us to pay � to give     11:37:31    15    more attention to our suspicious order          11:37:36    16    monitoring, but specifically this event is as   11:37:38    17    I just previously spoke, where we had a         11:37:41    18    Mallinckrodt person out at this facility, and   11:37:44    19    in retrospect they said it didn't look right    11:37:47    20    and it wound up to be a suspicious order.       11:37:50    21                  So we wanted to reeducate our      11:37:52    22    sales force about their reviewing customer      11:37:53    23    accounts when they were in there.               11:37:57    24          Q.     Sure. And I understand the        11:37:59    25    specific example you're giving, and I           11:38:00    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 40 (154 - 157)     Case: ^TTS^-WR^i^^tR^#^^3i^B^o 0?{&&�^^�diSmgi&�W&.ev,    Page 158    1    appreciate that. You have great recall about   11:38:02    2    that.                                         11:38:06    3                  But in terms of revising and       11:38:06    4    enhancing your SOM program, would it be         11:38:09    5    accurate to say that in early 2008, one of      11:38:12    6    the reasons why you wanted to do so was a       11:38:16    7    result of receiving the Rannazzisi letters?     11:38:19    8          A.     Yes.                              11:38:20    9          Q.     Okay. I want to hand you -       11:38:21    10    you can set that aside.                        11:3 8:24    11                  (Mallinckrodt-Harper Exhibit 5     11:38:25    12          marked for identification.)               11:38:25    13    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                           11:38:25    14          Q.     I want to hand you what's been     11:38:26    15    marked as Harper Exhibit 5, and that ends in    11:38:27    16    Bates stamp 273902. And this is an e-mail,     11:38:31    17    for the record, that you sent to several        11:38:45    18    people dated April 10, 2008.                   11:38:47    19                  Do you have any reason to doubt    11:38:51    20    that you sent this e-mail on this day and       11:38:55    21    time?                                         11:38:56    22          A.     I have no reason to doubt it.      11:38:56    23          Q.     Okay. And here you talk about     11:38:58    24    reference to the Drug and Chemical Advisory     11:39:01    25    Group. That's the group that we were           11:39:05    Page 160    1    questions taken from Southwood into a           11:40:12    2    checklist, correct?                            11:40:19    3          A.     Correct.                          11:40:19    4          Q.     And this checklist is reference    11:40:21    5    to a customer checklist that Mallinckrodt       11:40:24    6    utilized in connection with this SOM program,   11:40:27    7    correct?                                      11:40:30    8                  MR.

KO:                           11:40:34    13          Q.     Okay. So, and when you say        11:40:34    14    ""implemented at the time"" � thank you for      11:40:37    15    that - as of April 10, 2008, there wasn't      11:40:38    16    necessarily a checklist that was final,         11:40:42    17    correct?                                      11:40:44 There were several checklists.     11:40:45    11:40:49 So may I explain, please?          11:40:49    Sure.                             11:40:51    So there was a customer account    11:40:52    23    setup which had been in existence ad            11:40:53    24    infinitum, but this was a new customer          11:40:59 2 5   checklist that asked our customers to attest    11:41:01    18   A    19   Okay    20       21   Q    22   A    Page 159    1    discussing before that Frank Sapienza was       11:39:06    2    part of, correct?                              11:39:10    3          A.     Correct.                          11:39:12    4          Q.     And so at least as of this         11:39:12    5    time you are consulting with them � well, is   11:39:14    6    it fair to say that as of April 10, 2008, you   11:39:16    7    are consulting with the Drug and Chemical       11:39:18    8    Advisory Group in connection with your duties   11:39:20    9    to design and implement a suspicious order      11:39:21    10    monitoring program?                            11:39:24    11          A.     That's correct.                   11:39:24    12          Q.     Okay. And on the additional       11:39:26    13    items for consideration section, you talk       11:39:29    14    about the Southwood Federal Register Notice.    11:39:33    15                  Do you see that?                  11:39:37    16          A.     I do.                             11:39:38    17          Q.     And when you describe the          11:39:39    18    Southwood Federal Register Notice, you take     11:39:51    19    some important elements of that notice and      11:39:56 2 0    relay them to the people you are e-mailing      11:40:03    21    here.                                         11:40:05    22                  Do you see that?                  11:40:05    23          A.     I do.                             11:40:06    24          Q.     And so when you � you are         11:40:06    25    saying that you should incorporate certain      11:40:09    Page 161    1    to their � that they had a suspicious order    11:41:05    2    monitoring program. And we got that guidance   11:41:10    3    straight from Drug and Chemical Advisory        11:41:12    4    Group, that that would be a tool to augment     11:41:16    5    our program.                                  11:41:18    6          Q.     Okay. So a moment ago when you    11:41:18    7    said that there was always a customer account   11:41:21    8    setup, as far as you understood, in            11:41:23    9    connection with SOM procedure, prior to this    11:41:24    10    date was there ever a customer checklist that   11:41:28    11    was part of that customer account setup?        11:41:31    12          A.     Right. So, no, I'd like to        11:41:33    13    clarify because the previous checklist was      11:41:34    14    not in conjunction with SOM. So this is the    11:41:37    15    first SOM checklist.                          11:41:40    16          Q.     Great.                           11:41:41    17                 So accurate to say that as of      11:41:42    18    April of 2008, you are developing the first     11:41:45    19    customer checklist to be filled out in          11:41:47    20    connection with Mallinckrodt's SOM program?     11:41:50    21    Correct?                                     11:41:53    22          A.     That's correct.                   11:41:53    23          Q.     Okay. And some of the            11:41:54    24    questions that you want included in the         11:41:56 2 5    checklist, at least your suggestion, if I       11:41:59    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 41 (158 - 161)     Case: ^TTS^-WR^i^^tR^#^^3i^B^o 0?{&&�^^�diSmgi&�WJiev,    Page 162    1    understand correctly, is to try and determine   11:42:01    2    the overall percentage of controlled            11:42:03    3    substance filled by the pharmacy.               11:42:05    4                  Do you see that?                   11:42:06    5           A.     I do see that.                     11:42:07    6          Q.     And so that was an important       11:42:08    7    feature of the checklist to you at this time.   11:42:10    8                  MR.

Correct?                          11:42:13    12           A.     So it was--they were             11:42:13    13    statements taken from Southwood, and I'm        11:42:17    14    asking the question: Should we incorporate     11:42:19    15    these questions?                               11:42:21    16          Q.     Okay. And you're asking the       11:42:23    17    question, ""should we incorporate,"" because      11:42:27    18    you have received a Federal Register Notice     11:42:28    19    that suggests that you should consider asking   11:42:30    20    those questions, correct?                      11:42:32    21                  MR.

And one question that       11:42:35    Page 164 Southwood is to input into the checklist        11:43:27 identification of the percentage of             11:43:32    prescriptions filled by the -- filled by the    11:43:35 pharmacy that originate from the Internet.      11:43:37 Do you see that?                   11:43:39    MR. O'CONNOR: Objection to        11:43:39 form.                                    11:43:41    THE WITNESS: It was-yes, it    11:43:41 was stated � it was suggested in         11:43:42    Southwood's.                             11:43:44    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                            11:43:45    Q.     Okay. And that - you felt        11:43:45 that that was an important element to be        11:43:47 included in the checklist at the time,          11:43:49    correct?                                       11:43:51    A.     So I pulled - we pulled these     11:43:52    17    from Southwood's, but they were not             11:43:57    18    applicable to the questions we asked            11:43:59 distributors. Some of them became part of a    11:44:02 pharmacy information sheet, so I'm -- I'm       11:44:05 confusing the names of our forms, and I         11:44:08 apologize for that.                              11: 44:10    So this was taken from             11:44:11    Southwood's for evaluation by the team:         11:44:12    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    10    11    12    13    14    15    16    25   Could we, should we, incorporate these    11:44:14    Page 163    1    you believe you should ask in light of          11:42:38    2    reviewing Southwood is to determine the         11:42:41    3    overall percentage of controlled substances     11:42:42    4    filled by a particular pharmacy, correct?       11:42:44    5                  MR. O'CONNOR: Objection to        11:42:46    6          form.                                    11:42:47    7                  THE WITNESS: So we don't ship     11:42:47    8           to pharmacies, so we adapted the          11:42:50    9           spirit of this question to ask the        11:42:53    10           question of our distributor customers.    11:42:56    11    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                            11:42:59    12           Q.     Right.                            11:42:59    13                  But the idea is to understand,     11:43:00    14    notwithstanding the fact that you don't ship    11:43:02    15    directly to pharmacies, the idea is to          11:43:04    16    understand what overall percentage of a         11:43:08    17    controlled substance is being filled by a       11:43:12    18    downstream pharmacy, that is, a customer of     11:43:13    19    one of your distributors, correct?              11:43:17    20                  MR. O'CONNOR: Objection to        11:43:18    21           form.                                    11:43:19    22                  THE WITNESS: That's correct.      11:43:19    23    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                            11:43:19    24           Q.     Okay. And another important       11:43:20    2 5    question that you glean from your review of     11:43:25    Page 165 statements into our direct customer             11:44:17    checklist.                                     11:44:19    Q.     Right. And thank you for that.    11:44:19 So these are questions that you    11:44:21 believe should be incorporated into the new     11:44:23 customer checklist that you were working on     11:44:25 in April of 2008, correct?                      11:44:27    A.     I did not know if we should -     11:44:28 should use them.                               11:44:33    Q.     But you believe that they were     11:44:33 good suggestions pursuant to your review of     11:44:36 Southwood, correct?                            11:44:39    MR. O'CONNOR: Objection to        11:44:40 form.                                    11:44:41    THE WITNESS: So I pulled them     11:44:41 out of Southwood, but I was learning      11:44:42 more and more and more about the          11:44:43    business and our customers at the         11:44:45    time, and I did not know if these had     11:44:48 relevance to be added to this direct      11:44:50    11:44:54    11:44:55    customer checklist. QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:    Q.     Fair enough.                       11:44:55    Was the purpose of posing these    11:44:56 questions an attempt to understand more, as     11:45:00    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 42 (162 - 165)     Case: ^TTS^-WR^i^^tR^#^^3i^B^o 0?{&&4^^�diSmgi&�W&.ev,    Page 166    1    you said, about Mallinckrodt's business?        11:45:04    2    Correct?                                      11:45:06    3                  MR.

KO:                           11:45:09    7          Q.     And in particular, the             11:45:09    8    questions you posed here you were considering   11:45:11    9    to include in your checklist because they       11:45: 15    10    provide details of the downstream customer      11:45:18    11    that purchases drugs from distributors that     11:45:21    12    you ship and sell to directly, correct?         11:45:25    13                  MR. O'CONNOR: Objection to        11:45:27    14          form.                                   11:45:28    15                  THE WITNESS: Correct.             11:45:28    16    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                           11:45:32    17          Q.     So is it fair to say that you      11:45:33    18    are trying to understand details of where       11:45:35    19    Mallinckrodt drugs end up in terms of which     11:45:41 2 0    pharmacy or clinic they go to?                 11:45:45    21                  MR.

Is that       11:45:51    3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10    Page 168    1    questions as you learned from Southwood was     11:46:50    2    to understand more about the downstream         11:46:52 customer of a distributor that you ship drugs   11:46:54 to?                                               11:46:57    MR. O'CONNOR: Objection to        11:46:57 form.                                   11:46:58    THE WITNESS: Yes.                11:46:58    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                          11:47:01    Q.     Okay. Thank you.                 11:47:02    There's also a reference made,     11:47:04    11    next item down � next paragraph, excuse me,    11:47:08    12    starting with ""Kim France."" Do you see         11:47:13    13    there's a reference made to IntegriChain?       11:47:16    14                 To help orient you, I've           11:47:21    15    highlighted it on the screen for you.           11:47:23    16          A.     Oh, thankyou.                    11:47:25    17          Q.     Yeah.                            11:47:25    18          A.     Yes, I see it.                    11:47:34    19          Q.     Okay. And you participated in     11:47:35    20    the potential retention of IntegriChain, did    11:47:37    21    you not?                                     11:47:42    22          A.     Correct.                         11:47:42    23          Q.     Okay. And so did Kimberly         11:47:42    24    France, as I understand it?                    11:47:49    25          A.     Yes.                             11:47:50    Page 167    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    10    11    12    13    14    15    16    17    18    19    20    21    22    23    24    25    11:45:54    11:45:54    all right with you? QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:    Q.     Yeah, sure.                       11:45:55    A.     So this was within the scope of    11:45:55 the suspicious order checklist going to our     11:45:59 direct customers. Okay? So these questions    11:46:02 were not applicable to our business because     11:46:07 we sold to wholesaler and distributor.          11:46:08    But as time went on, we            11:46:10    developed a pharmacy information sheet which,   11:46:13 when we had conversations with the             11:46:16    distributors about their customers, we asked    11:46:18 these questions from Southwood's: Are you      11:46:21 aware that your pharmacy customer has these     11:46:25 percentages, et cetera.                        11:46:27    So there are two checklists,       11:46:28 and I think they're getting interchanged        11:46:29 here, and I apologize for the confusion.        11:46:31    Q.     That's okay. I appreciate the     11:46:33 response. I just have a simple yes or no       11:46:37 question.                                     11:46:40    A.     All right.                        11:46:41    Q.     Is it accurate to say, yes or      11:46:41 no, that one of the reasons why you are         11:46:44    suggesting the consideration of these           11:46:46    Page 169    1          Q.     And who is Ms. France?            11:47:50    2          A.     She was - she was with the        11:47:51    3    patient and product monitoring group that had   11:47:53    4    a different focus and goal than the DEA        11:47:56    5    compliance group.                            11:48:00    6          Q.     Okay. And both she and you        11:48:01    7    were involved in the potential retention of     11:48:06    8    IntegriChain during this 2008 time period,      11:48:08    9    correct?                                    11:48:12    10          A.     Yes, among others, yes.           11:48:12    11          Q.     Okay. And this e-mail            11:48:14    12    specifically states from you that ""one of the   11:48:16    13    goals of the Mallinckrodt IntegriChain         11:48:19    14    project being considered as part of RiskMAP     11:48:22    15    is to combine prescription data from Verispan   11:48:24    16    and IMS, added Mallinckrodt sales data and,     11:48:28    17    coupled with ARCOS data from DEA, to provide    11:48:32    18    a mechanism to detect diversion through the     11:48:34    19    supply chain.""                               11:48:37    20                 Did I read that correctly?         11:48:38    21          A.     Yes, you did.                    11:48:39    22          Q.     Okay. And so was one of the       11:48:42    23    purposes of trying to retain IntegriChain to    11:48:44    2 4    understand where Mallinckrodt prescription      11:48:48    25    opioids were ending up once they had left       11:48:52    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 43 (166 - 169)     Case: pVi^n^                                        0?{&&�^^�diSmgi&�W&.ev,    Page 170    1    Mallinckrodt facilities in Hobart and           11:48:54    2    St. Louis?                                     11:48:56    3           A.     We were looking at that as a       11:48:57    4    possibility, yes.                              11:49:01    5           Q.     Okay. And so you were trying      11:49:01    6    to understand and trying to detect diversion    11:49:02    7    throughout the supply chain with the help of    11:49:05    8    IntegriChain; is that correct?                  11:49:09    9                  MR. O'CONNOR: Objection to        11:49:11    10           form.                                    11:49:12    11                  THE WITNESS: Yes, that is the     11:49:12    12           service they offered, yes.                11:49:13    13    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                            11:49:20    14           Q.     Okay. And can you generally       11:49:21    15    describe to the Court your involvement with     11:49:22    16    this project?                                  11:49:23    17           A.     IntegriChain came in to            11:49:24    18    Mallinckrodt and gave one or two                11:49:28    19    presentations. I'm not certain. And then we   11:49:30 2 0    evaluated the merit of adding that to our       11:49:35    21    suspicious order monitoring, and we decided     11:49:39    22    not to add IntegriChain's services.             11:49:40    23           Q.     And why did you decide not to      11:49:43    24    retain them?                                   11:49:45    25           A.     So IntegriChain was a vendor,      11:49:45    Page 172    1                  Do you have any reason to          11:50:58    2    dispute that?                                  11:50:59    3                  MR. O'CONNOR: Objection to        11:51:00    4          form.                                    11:51:00    5                  THE WITNESS: I have no reason     11:51:00    6          to dispute it.                            11:51:01    7    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                            11:51:02    8          Q.     Okay. So do you recall            11:51:02    9    actually asking for approval from Mr. Ratliff   11:51:04    10    to participate in the potential retention of    11:51:07    11    IntegriChain?                                  11:51:09    12          A.     I do.                             11:51:10    13          Q.     Okay. And that was obviously      11:51:11    14    prior to this date, but do you recall whether   11:51:13    15    or not that was in the 2007 time period?        11:51:15    16          A.     I don't recall the date, I'm       11:51:17    17    sorry.                                         11:51:21    18          Q.     Okay. I want to go forward to     11:51:21    19    the second attachment, titled ""IntegriChain     11:51:29    20    Pilot Program and Overview."" And I don't �    11:51:33    21    we don't need to go through this in detail,     11:51:36    22    but do you recall who actually drafted this     11:51:38    23    language?                                      11:51:45    24          A.     It was not me.                     11:51:46    25          Q.     Okay. Was it someone at           11:51:49    Page 171    1    and their data collection did not add value     11:49:49    2    from our perspective to our suspicious order    11:49:54    3    monitoring program at the time.                11:49:57    4          Q.     Uh-huh. And why did you feel      11:49:58    5    like they did not add value?                  11:50:00    6          A.     Well, it was a multitude of        11:50:01    7    data from different sources, not necessarily    11:50:06    8    specific to Mallinckrodt data, and we          11:50:10    9    evaluated it, as I said.                      11:50:14    10                 This also says ""coupled with       11:50:16    11    ARCOS data from DEA."" DEA has steadfastly      11:50:18    12    throughout time refused to share ARCOS data     11:50:22    13    with anyone, and so that was another key        11:50:25    14    component of their program.                   11:50:28    15                 So for those reasons we           11:50:31    16    declined the service.                         11:50:32    17          Q.     Do you recall how long you         11:50:34    18    evaluated whether or not you were going to      11:50:35    19    retain IntegriChain?                          11:50:36    20          A.     It was straightaway, shortly       11:50:38    21    after their one or two presentations.           11:50:42    22          Q.     Okay. I have seen reference to    11:50:46    2 3    documents in which you have � you have asked   11:50:51    24    approval from Bill Ratliff to be part of the    11:50:53    25    IntegriChain project.                         11:50:56    Page 173    1    Mallinckrodt?                                  11:51:50    2          A.     I do not know, or if it was        11:51:50    3    IntegriChain.                                  11:51:53    4          Q.     Okay. But as far as you know,     11:51:54    5    you didn't draft this particular language,      11:51:55    6    correct?                                       11:51:57    7          A.     I'm positive I did not.            11:51:57    8          Q.     Okay. Despite not knowing who     11:51:59    9    may have drafted it, as you said, you were      11:52:07    10    considering retention of IntegriChain because   11:52:09    11    they were going to hopefully help detect        11:52:13    12    diversion throughout the supply chain. So      11:52:17    13    separate and apart from what I'm                11:52:19    14    highlighting, sorry.                            11:52:22    15          A.     Oh, I'm sorry.                     11:52:22    16          Q.     Yeah, no, that's okay. Let me     11:52:23    17    repeat.                                        11:52:25    18          A.     Okay.                             11:52:26    19          Q.     You were considering the           11:52:26    2 0    retention of IntegriChain because they were     11:52:27    21    going to help detect diversion throughout the   11:52:30    22    supply chain, correct?                         11:52:31    23                  MR. O'CONNOR: Objection to        11:52:32    24          form.                                    11:52:33    25                  THE WITNESS: Yes, that was        11:52:33    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 44 (170 - 173)     Case: Hi^hTf                                        0?{&&�^^�diSmgi&�182Piev,    1          what they advertised. Yes.    2    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:    3          Q.     That was the intent?    4          A.     Yes.    Page 174 11:52:33    11:52:36 11:52:37 11:52:37    5          Q.     And one of the ways that they      11:52:38    6    would do that was through capturing � at       11:52:39    7    least representing to you that they would       11:52:41    8    capture detailed data, correct?                11:52:43    9          A.     Correct.                         11:52:45    10          Q.     And so � and in particular, in    11:52:46    11    the second sentence of this background          11:52:48    12    material, it indicates that ""detailed data      11:52:51    13    through surveillance and pharmacovigilance is   11:52:56    14    an important resource for the company.""         11:53:00    15                 Do you see that?                  11:53:02    16          A.     I do see that.                    11:53:03    17          Q.     Would you agree with that          11:53:03    18    statement?                                   11:53:04    19          A.     I would not.                      11:53:04    20          Q.     You don't believe detailed data    11:53:05    21    is an important resource for the company?       11:53:08    22          A.     I don't understand how             11:53:09    23    pharmacovigilance, which in my understanding    11:53:10    24    is adverse event reporting, could be an         11:53:12    25    important resource for the company.             11:53:18    Page 176    1    described it as being a report of adverse       11:54:08    2    events, correct?                               11:54:10    3          A.     Yes.                              11:54:11    4          Q.     Why would - why would not         11:54:12    5    considering an adverse event be a fruitful      11:54:17    6    thing to do in connection with trying to        11:54:20    7    detect suspicious orders?                      11:54:22    8                  MR. O'CONNOR: Objection to        11:54:23    9          form.                                   11:54:24    10                  THE WITNESS: Adverse events       11:54:25    11          were handled by patient and product       11:54:27    12          monitoring, and they were events such     11:54:30    13          as a doctor had a patient on the          11:54:34    14          operating table and had administered a    11:54:35    15          Mallinckrodt medication and there was     11:54:37    16          some unexpected symptom occurring. So    11:54:38    17          it was like a hotline of                 11:54:44    18          pharmacovigilance.                       11:54:47    19    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                           11:54:49    20          Q.     Okay. And was that - did -      11:54:49    21    during your time at Mallinckrodt, did you 11:54:51 2 2    ever receive � or were you aware of any 11:54:54 2 3    adverse event reports related to diversion?     11:55:00    24                  MR. O'CONNOR: Objection to        11:55:02    25          form.                                   11:55:03    Page 175    1                  Also, this statement � may I      11:53:20    2    say something else, please?                     11:53:22    3           Q.     Ofcourse.                         11:53:24    4           A.     So this document, it switches      11:53:24    5    back and forth, so it's confusing in terms of   11:53:26    6    they're talking about ""the company,""            11:53:30    7    Mallinckrodt, but then ""our company,""           11:53:33    8    indicating IntegriChain.                        11:53:36    9                  So it's difficult to - to         11:53:38    10    define every sentence and under--              11:53:43    11           Q.     Sure. Fair enough.                11:53:46    12           A.     Thank you. Thank you.             11:53:47    13           Q.     Fair enough. And we can put       11:53:47    14    the document aside because I don't mean to      11:53:49    15    put you through a memory test of the actual     11:53:51    16    document.                                      11:53:53    17           A.     Okay.                             11:53:53    18           Q.     I would just ask you separately    11:53:53    19    whether or not you believe detailed data is     11:53:55    20    an important resource for the company to        11:53:57    21    utilize in trying to detect diversion.          11:54:00    22           A.     Yes. In general, yes.             11:54:03    23           Q.     Okay. And a moment ago when       11:54:04    24    you were talking about what your                11:54:06    25    understanding of pharmacovigilance is, you      11:54:06    Page 177    1                  THE WITNESS: Yes.                 11:55:03    2    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                            11:55:08    3          Q.     Okay. And did you - during       11:55:08    4    your time at Mallinckrodt, didyouever         11:55:13    5    receive or were you aware of any adverse        11:55:15    6    event reports related to the abuse of           11:55:18    7    prescription opioids manufactured by            11:55:20    8    Mallinckrodt?                                  11:55:23    9          A.     Yes.                              11:55:24    10          Q.     Okay. And notwithstanding the     11:55:27    11    fact that some of these adverse event reports   11:55:29    12    included instances of diversion and abuse,      11:55:31    13    you don't believe that it was necessary to      11:55:35    14    include these -- or consider these reports in   11:55:37    15    connection with Mallinckrodt's duties to        11:55:40    16    implement and design a suspicious order         11:55:42    17    monitoring program?                            11:55:44    18                  MR.

The adverse event that was         11:58:05    11    reported was a result of someone � the         11:58:08    12    allegation was stealing fentanyl patches from   11:58:12    13    a glove compartment of a car that was hot.      11:58:16    14    Fentanyl, the active ingredient is activated    11:58:19    15    by heat. And so the person who suffered the    11:58:21    16    adverse event had stolen the fentanyl,          11:58:24    17    allegedly, taken it and, yes, overdosed. And   11:58:27    18    I don't know if they expired or not. I know    11:58:32    19    there was a medical emergency.                  11:58:35    20          Q.     Isn't that an example of           11:58:37    21    diversion leading to an opioid overdose?        11:58:39    22          A.     Yes, it's diversion at the         11:58:41    23    patient level, yes.                            11:58:47    24          Q.     Okay. And diversion at the        11:58:47    25    patient level is something that would be        11:58:49    Page 179    1    of Mallinckrodt prescription opioids that       11:56:44    2    were contained in such adverse event reports    11:56:47    3    as you testified?                              11:56:49    4           A.

I don't know when she started.     12:15:07    15    Clearly it was in May of 2008, but I don't      12:15:12    16    know the start or the end date of when she      12:15:15    17    became part of the initiative.                  12:15:18    18          Q.     And you attended a - you          12:15:21    19    attended a conference with her �               12:15:27    20          A.     Yes.                              12:15:28    21          Q.     - in 2008, correct?               12:15:29    22          A.     Yes.                              12:15:30    23          Q.     And this was, I believe, in        12:15:30    24    October of 2008, and it was the Buzzeo          12:15:32    25    conference?                                   12:15:36    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 47 (182 - 185)     Case: fti^n^                                        0?{&&�^^�diSmgi&�182&.ev,    Page 186    1          A.     Yes.                              12:15:36    2          Q.     And I know that postdates the      12:15:36    3    date of this letter, but do you recall anyone   12:15:38    4    else attending that conference other than you   12:15:42    5    and Cathy from Mallinckrodt?                   12:15:45    6          A.     I do not.                         12:15:47    7          Q.     Okay. So as far as you recall,    12:15:48    8    you were the only � you and Cathy were the     12:15:55    9    only two that attended the Buzzeo conference    12:15:57    10    in 2008?                                      12:16:00    11          A.     Yes.                              12:16:01    12          Q.     And what was her position          12:16:01    13    during the 2008 time period?                   12:16:03    14          A.     Manager of dosage customer         12:16:04    15    service.                                      12:16:09    16          Q.     Okay. So she was a customer       12:16:09    17    service rep � or sorry, excuse me. She was    12:16:11    18    involved in the customer service group,         12:16:14    19    correct?                                      12:16:16    20          A.     Correct. The reps reported to     12:16:16    21    her.                                          12:16:17    22          Q.     Right.                            12:16:18    23                  And so she, at least of this       12:16:18    24    time, was having some involvement in the        12:16:23    25    revising of Mallinckrodt's SOM program; is      12:16:25    Page 188    1          A.     Yes.                             12:17:23    2          Q.     So Ms. Stewart is at this time,    12:17:24    3    as of May 14, 2008, working with you and        12:17:27    4    Mr. Ratliff to specifically ensure that         12:17:32    5    Mallinckrodt maintains compliance with DEA      12:17:40    6    requirements related to identification of       12:17:42    7    suspicious orders, correct?                    12:17:44    8          A.     I don't see the word              12:17:45    9    ""specifically,"" but, yes, she was assisting     12:17:49    10    with enhancing the program.                    12:17:52    11          Q.     Okay. And then she also           12:17:55    12    mentioned � mentions that ""in light of the     12:17:57    13    recent developments with McKesson, a good       12:17:59    14    deal of focus is being placed on this           12:18:02    15    project.""                                    12:18:03    16                 Do you see that?                  12:18:04    17          A.     I do.                            12:18:04    18          Q.     And is she referring to a DEA      12:18:05    19    investigation that ultimately resulted in a     12:18:08    20    DEA action against McKesson in the early 2008   12:18:12    21    time period?                                  12:18:16    22          A.     Yes.                             12:18:16    23          Q.     Okay. And McKesson, as we         12:18:17    24    mentioned before, is a � is one of the � or   12:18:21    25    one of the major distributors that faced DEA    12:18:23    Page 187    1    that fair to say?                             12:16:29    2          A.     Yes.                             12:16:29    3          Q.     Okay. And also it appears that    12:16:30    4    at this time the customer service group is      12:16:33    5    having some involvement in the implementation   12:16:35    6    of the revised SOM program.                    12:16:38    7                 Separate and apart from what       12:16:39    8    the e-mail says, is it your recollection that   12:16:41    9    the customer service group had some            12:16:44    10    involvement in the revising of Mallinckrodt's   12:16:45    11    SOM program in 2008?                          12:16:47    12                 MR. O'CONNOR: Objection to        12:16:49    13          form.                                   12:16:50    14                 THE WITNESS: Yes.                12:16:50    15    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                          12:16:50    16          Q.     Okay. Ms. Stewart says that -    12:16:51    17    in particular that she is advising everyone     12:17:00    18    on this e-mail that she is working with you     12:17:03    19    and Mr. Harper to develop procedures to         12:17:06    20    ensure that Mallinckrodt maintains compliance   12:17:11    21    with DEA requirements to identify suspicious    12:17:15 2 2    orders; is that correct?                       12:17:18    23          A.     So I'm Harper, and it talks        12:17:18    24    about working with me and Bill Ratliff.         12:17:21    25          Q.     Right.                           12:17:23    Page 189    1    scrutiny regarding their distribution of        12:18:25    2    prescription opioids, correct?                 12:18:28    3          A.     Yes.                              12:18:29    4          Q.     Okay. Now, she goes on to         12:18:32    5    describe generally when an order is deemed      12:18:34    6    peculiar by a customer service rep.             12:18:41    7                  Do you see that?                  12:18:42    8          A.     Uh-huh. Yes.                     12:18:42    9          Q.     And she says that ""an order is     12:18:44    10    deemed peculiar by a customer service rep       12:18:50    11    based on a set of guidelines currently being    12:18:52    12    developed.""                                   12:18:56    13                  Do you see that reference?         12:18:56    14                  First sentence of the second       12:19:05    15    paragraph.                                    12:19:07    16          A.     Yes, yes, yes, I see it. Yes,     12:19:07    17    thank you.                                    12:19:08    18          Q.     So fair to say as of May 14,       12:19:08    19    2008, Mallinckrodt is developing certain        12:19:13    20    guidelines to determine whether or not an       12:19:15    21    order is peculiar?                             12:19:17    22          A.     It's not correct.                  12:19:20    23          Q.     Okay. Is it - is that - is      12:19:21    24    your testimony that if s not correct because    12:19:24    25    you always had a system to determine whether    12:19:25    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 48 (186 - 189)     Case: fti^nu^                                               0?{&&p0&^�dilmgi&�182&.ev,    Page 190    1    or not an order was peculiar?                   12:19:28    2           A.     That's correct.                    12:19:29    3           Q.     Okay. So is it fair to say        12:19:30    4    that as of May 14, 2008, you are revising the   12:19:31    5    set of guidelines to determine whether or not   12:19:37    6    it's peculiar?                                 12:19:39    7           A.     Yes.                              12:19:40    8           Q.     Okay. And what is the             12:19:41    9    difference from your perspective between a      12:19:47    10    peculiar order and a suspicious order?          12:19:49    11           A.     We - at different times with      12:19:51    12    the enhancements of our program, we called      12:19:58    13    orders ""peculiar,"" we called orders             12:20:01    14    ""unusual,"" and we called orders ""suspicious.""   12:20:03    15    So at this time, the peculiar order was         12:20:06    16    something that came to our attention and        12:20:10    17    warranted additional review but was not         12:20:14    18    necessarily deemed to be suspicious.            12:20:17    19          Q.     Okay. So a peculiar order, if     12:20:19    20    I understand your testimony correctly, is not   12:20:21    21    necessarily synonymous with a suspicious        12:20:23    22    order; is that correct?                        12:20:26    23           A.     Correct.                           12:20:26    24           Q.     Okay. And if I understand both    12:20:28    25    this e-mail and some other documents I've       12:20:32    Page 192    1    could have been anything that came to the       12:21:34    2    customer service rep's attention as them        12:21:35    3    being familiar with the account.                12:21:39    4          Q.     Okay. Because as you testified    12:21:41    5    previously, they were your eyes and ears to     12:21:43    6    the customer, correct?                         12:21:47    7          A.     That was the NAMs. But, yes,      12:21:48    8    the customer service reps were veterans with    12:21:49    9    the accounts, and, yes, they knew the           12:21:51    10    customers.                                    12:21:56    11          Q.     So would you agree � because I    12:21:56    12    realize that you are trying to make a           12:22:04    13    distinction between the NAMs and the CSRs.      12:22:08    14                  But would it be fair to say        12:22:11    15    that the CSRs had deep knowledge about the      12:22:12    16    customers?                                    12:22:16    17                  MR. O'COMSfOR: Objection to        12:22:16    18          form.                                   12:22:17    19    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                           12:22:17    20          Q.     Of Mallinckrodt?                  12:22:17    21          A.     I wouldn't use the term ""deep      12:22:18    22    knowledge."" They had knowledge of the          12:22:22    23    customers from the customer service             12:22:24    24    perspective.                                  12:22:26    25          Q.     Okay. And when you said           12:22:27    Page 191    1    reviewed, my understanding is that once an      12:20:35    2    order is identified as peculiar, certain        12:20:38    3    people make the determination of whether or     12:20:42    4    not the order is ultimately suspicious          12:20:44    5    sufficient to notify the DEA; is that           12:20:46    6    accurate?                                      12:20:48    7                  MR.

KO:                            12:20:50    11           Q.     Okay. And so for purposes of      12:20:50    12    this e-mail from Ms. Stewart to you, among      12:20:54    13    others, she is discussing a revision of what    12:20:58    14    determines a peculiar order, correct?           12:21:03    15           A.     A peculiar order as recognized     12:21:05    16    by customer service.                            12:21:11    17           Q.     Okay.                             12:21:12    18           A.     Yes.                              12:21:12    19          Q.     And is it accurate to say that     12:21:13    20    a peculiar order � whether or not an order     12:21:17    21    was deemed peculiar was based on an             12:21:22    22    algorithm, as we discussed earlier; is that     12:21:25    23    correct?                                       12:21:29    24           A.     That was one of the reasons,       12:21:29    25    but in the case of a customer service rep, it   12:21:31    Page 193    1    earlier that the NAMs were your eyes and        12:22:29    2    ears, would you also say that the customer      12:22:34    3    service reps to some extent were the eyes and   12:22:36    4    ears for the Mallinckrodt business as well?     12:22:38    5          A.     If you use the term � making      12:22:40    6    an inferential leap, because the customer       12:22:45    7    service reps didn't see the customers or �     12:22:48    8    they talked to the customers and took          12:22:50    9    customer orders.                              12:22:52    10          Q.     Okay. Let me make sure I          12:22:53    11    understand it.                                12:22:55    12                 They didn't see the customers,     12:22:55    13    but they talked to them?                       12:22:57    14          A.     Yes.                             12:22:58    15          Q.     Okay. So they didn't actually     12:22:58    16    visit them like the NAMs did, but they would    12:23:00    17    speak to them via telephone only?              12:23:03    18                 MR.

KO:                          12:23:06    22          Q.     But the CSRs had, through these    12:23:06    23    conversations, presumably had knowledge about   12:23:10    24    the customers, correct?                        12:23:11    25          A.     Yes.                             12:23:13    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 49 (190 - 193)     Case: fti^nu^                                               0?{&&Pk$^�diSmgi&�182$iev,    Page 194    1           Q.     Turning back to this               12:23:20    2    distinction between peculiar and suspicious,    12:23:21    3    do you ever recall an instance in which an      12:23:23    4    order was identified as suspicious but not      12:23:25    5    peculiar?                                      12:23:30    6          A.     I don't know that answer.          12:23:31    7           Q.     Okay. Do you ever recall an       12:23:32    8    instance in which an order was identified as    12:23:36    9    unusual but not peculiar?                       12:23:38    10           A.     I can't say. I'm sorry.           12:23:39    11           Q.     Okay. Is it accurate to           12:23:43    12    describe at least the--well, strike that.     12:23:45    13                  Prior to the revision of the       12:23:50    14    SOM program in 2008 that's reflected in these   12:23:55    15    e-mails that we're going over, is it accurate   12:24:00    16    to say that an order was first � an            12:24:04    17    evaluation was made first about whether or      12:24:10    18    not an order was peculiar, separate and apart   12:24:11    19    from an analysis of whether or not an order     12:24:14    20    was suspicious?                                12:24:15    21                  MR.

Okay. All right. Okay. Thank    12:25:35    2    you.                                          12:25:35    3          Q.     � and I'm trying to understand    12:25:35    4    the distinctions between them.                  12:25:39    5          A.     Okay. Thank you.                  12:25:40    6          Q.     So with respect to                12:25:42    7    identification of a peculiar order, you had     12:25:43    8    previously testified that if an order met a     12:25:44    9    certain threshold by an algorithm determined    12:25:53    10    by Mallinckrodt, it would be deemed peculiar.   12:25:55    11                  MR. O'CONNOR: Objection to        12:25:58    12          form.                                   12:25:59    13    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                           12:25:59    14          Q.     Correct?                          12:25:59    15          A.     Correct.                          12:25:59    16          Q.     And in addition to the             12:26:00    17    algorithm triggering a peculiar order, you      12:26:03    18    had also testified that there were other        12:26:06    19    circumstances that may indicate an order was    12:26:08 2 0    peculiar as identified by a customer service    12:26:11    12:26:14 A.     Correct.                          12:26:14    Q.     Okay. And who other than the      12:26:15    24    CSRs had a responsibility or an obligation to   12:26:20    25    determine whether or not this order was         12:26:26    21   rep, correct?    22 23    Page 195 QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                           12:24:23    Q.     So in addition to it being a       12:24:24 term that you used, is it accurate to say       12:24:26 that at Mallinckrodt, before making a           12:24:28    determination with respect to whether an        12:24:31 order was suspicious, the existing SOM          12:24:33    7    program at the time determined first whether    12:24:37    8    an order was peculiar?                         12:24:39 A.     Yes, that was the term we used,    12:24:42    yes.                                          12:24:46    Q.     And then once an order was         12:24:46    deemed to be peculiar, you subsequently made    12:24:48 a determination of whether or not that order    12:24:50    14    was suspicious, correct?                       12:24:53    15          A.     Yes.                              12:24:55    16          Q.     Okay. And you had mentioned a     12:24:56    17    moment ago that there were other               12:25:11    18    circumstances besides the algorithm that    19    would potentially make an order peculiar.    20 21 22    12:25:14 12:25:17    Do you recall that?                12:25:20    A.     Yes. I'm using the terms          12:25:21    'peculiar,"" ""suspicious,"" ""unusual,""            12:25:26    23    interchangeably, yes.                          12:25:31    24          Q.     Okay. Well, I would not like      12:25:32    25    to use those words interchangeably �           12:25:35    Page 197    1    peculiar?                                     12:26:28    2                  MR. O'CONNOR: Objection to        12:26:28    3          form.                                   12:26:29    4                  THE WITNESS: Peculiar, using      12:26:29    5          the strictest definition of the term.     12:26:37    6          The national account managers, if they    12:26:43    7          saw something when they were at the       12:26:43    8          accounts, the customer service review     12:26:43    9          and the peculiar order algorithm          12:26:50    10          detection, yes.                          12:26:50    11    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                           12:26:52    12          Q.     Okay. So I'm setting aside the    12:26:52    13    algorithm detection.                           12:26:54    14          A.     Okay.                             12:26:55    15          Q.     So for purposes of identifying     12:26:56    16    an order as peculiar, do you recall any         12:26:59    17    instances in the 2007 through 2010 time         12:27:00    18    period in which orders were identified as       12:27:03    19    peculiar by either a CSR or an NAM, separate    12:27:05    20    and apart from whether or not an algorithm      12:27:10    21    triggered the order to be peculiar?             12:27:14    22          A.     Yes.                              12:27:17    23          Q.     Okay. And other than the CSRs     12:27:18    24    and the NAMs, did anyone else have              12:27:22    25    responsibility with respect to determining      12:27:25    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 50 (194 - 197)     Case: fti^nu^                                               0?{&&P%$^di>imgi&�182&.ev,    Page 198    1    whether or not that order was peculiar?         12:27:26    2    Separate and apart from the algorithm.          12:27:32    3          A.     Separate from the algorithm?       12:27:33    4                 So may I ask a question,           12:27:37    5    please?                                      12:27:38    6          Q.     Sure.                            12:27:38    7          A.     So there was � we spoke           12:27:39    8    earlier about a circumstance where a DEA        12:27:40    9    investigator contacted Mallinckrodt. It was    12:27:44    10    a compounding pharmacy. So I don't know if     12:27:48    11    that was within the same time frame.            12:27:50    12                 But so my point is, peculiar       12:27:52    13    order information could come from an external   12:27:56    14    source, potentially.                          12:27:59    15          Q.     Okay. So other than an           12:28:00    16    external source or from some evaluation made    12:28:03    17    by a CSR or an NAM, apart from the algorithm    12:28:06    18    that triggered a peculiar order, were there     12:28:11    19    any other circumstances in which a peculiar     12:28:15    20    order was identified at Mallinckrodt?           12:28:19    21          A.     No.                              12:28:20    22          Q.     Okay. Is it your understanding    12:28:21    23    that Mallinckrodt could not ship a peculiar     12:28:30    24    order without first conducting some sort of     12:28:37    25    due diligence on that order?                   12:28:38    Page 200    1    necessary to determine whether or not that      12:29:18    2    is, in fact, suspicious, correct?              12:29:21    3          A.     Correct.                         12:29:22    4          Q.     So it's your testimony sitting     12:29:23    5    here today that you did not always perform      12:29:27    6    due diligence on peculiar orders before         12:29:29    7    shipping them, correct?                        12:29:31    8                 MR.

Shipping of a peculiar      12:30:03    13    order without doing due diligence would seem    12:30:04    14    contradictory to what Ms. Stewart is trying     12:30:06    15    to describe here, right?                       12:30:10    16                 MR.

And to be clear, so the     12:30:17    21    record is clear, she is suggesting that if an   12:30:21    22    order is deemed peculiar, it should be placed   12:30:23    23    on hold and the DEA compliance group will be    12:30:26    24    advised.                                     12:30:30    25                 Do you see that?                  12:30:30    Page 199 i          A.     It is not.                         12:28:39    2                  MR. O'CONNOR: Objection to        12:28:39    3           form.                                     12:28:40    4    QUESTIONS BY MR.

It is not your understanding.      12:28:41    6                  So a peculiar order could ship     12:28:42    7    without conducting due diligence then,          12:28:43    8    correct?                                        12:28:45    9           A.     Correct.                           12:28:45    io          Q.     Okay. So isn't that an unusual    12:28:46    11    circumstance?                                   12:28:55    12                  MR.

In other words, if you're not      12:28:57    16    performing any � earlier we made a             12:29:01    17    distinction between peculiar and suspicious     12:29:03    18    orders, correct?                                12:29:05    19           A.

And the latter is something        12:29:05    21    that you ultimately have to report to the       12:29:07    22    DEA, correct?                                   12:29:08    23           A.     Correct.                           12:29:09    24           Q.

I do.                             12:30:31    2          Q.     And in particular, Mr. Ratliff     12:30:32    3    and you are the DEA compliance group as         12:30:34    4    referenced by Ms. Stewart, correct?             12:30:38    5          A.

And she also states that ""DEA      12:30:40    7    compliance will then conduct a more in-depth    12:30:44    8    investigation and determine if the situation    12:30:47    9    warrants notification to the DEA.""              12:30:49    10                  Do you see that?                  12:30:51    11          A.     I do see it.                      12:30:52    12          Q.     And so your testimony, so the      12:30:53    13    record is clear, is that that more in-depth     12:30:55    14    investigation did not always occur, correct?    12:30:58    15                  MR.

Now, a moment ago you       12:31:41    15    said that you believe you never shipped a       12:32:03    16    suspicious order, correct?                      12:32:04    17           A.     Correct.                           12:32:05    18           Q.     But that is just simply based      12:32:05    19    on your understanding of whether or not that    12:32:09    20    formal label was made by someone at             12:32:11    21    Mallinckrodt, correct?                         12:32:15    22                  MR.

Hope to identify an algorithm that       12:34:05    5    will support a parsing through the data to      12:34:08    6    identify patterns, frequency, et cetera.""       12:34:10    7                  Did I read that correctly?         12:34:13    8          A.     Yes, you did.                      12:34:14    9          Q.

Yes.                            12:38:05    13          Q.     And it was your hope to roll       12:38:06    14    out an enhanced version as quickly as          12:38:08    15    possible; is that fair to say?                 12:38:11    16          A.     Yes.                            12:38:12    17          Q.     And if s important to roll out     12:38:13    18    an enhanced SOM program because failure to do   12:38:15    19    so would result in further diversion and        12:38:18 2 0    abuse of - potentially of Mallinckrodt         12:38:21    21    opioids, correct?                            12:38:24    22                 MR.

Okay. And to be clear, is the     12:36:40 sales force discussed here and as you just      12:36:41 testified to, are you talking about NAMs and    12:36:46 CSRs or both?

So the sales force          12:36:55    described in this e-mail is just with respect   12:36:56 to the national account managers, correct?      12:36:58 A.     Yes.                             12:37:00    Q.     Okay. And you can set that        12:37:00 aside. Thank you.                            12:37:14    Now, is it fair to say that in     12:37:21    15    the early 2008 time period you were working     12:37:27    16    on revising and revamping Mallinckrodt's SOM    12:37:28    17    program?

Did you feel that backbone SOM     12:38:32    4    program was sufficient in terms of complying    12:38:34    5    with your duties under the CSA?                12:38:36    6          A.     Yes.                              12:38:38    7          Q.     Okay. Well, then why did you      12:38:39    8    feel the need to enhance it?                   12:38:41    9          A.     Because as time went on, we got    12:38:42    10    further guidance from DEA. Any piece of        12:38:44    11    information that we gleaned, we acted upon it   12:38:47    12    immediately. And we led the industry in        12:38:51    13    every aspect of enhancing our suspicious        12:38:53    14    order monitoring program.                      12:38:57    15          Q.

Is that what      12:39:07    20    your testimony is today?                       12:39:12    21          A.     So immediately - that was a       12:39:12    22    poor choice of words. As soon as possible,     12:39:16    23    yes.                                          12:39:18    24          Q.     Okay. And what does ""as soon      12:39:19    25    as possible"" mean to you?                      12:39:21    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 53 (206 - 209)     Case: fti^nTy-                                        0?{&&P^^�dilmgi&�182&.ev,    Page 210 12:39:21    MR.

Yes.                              12:41:44    9          Q.     And so there were frequent         12:41:44    10    calls at the time to try and better             12:41:45    11    understand and gain knowledge of the supply     12:41:47    12    chain process?                                 12:41:51    13          A.

I can't answer that because        12:40:14    5    enhancements are always ongoing. They're       12:40:18    6    ongoing up to today. So there's no start and   12:40:21    7    stop time to the enhancements.                  12:40:24    8                  (Mallinckrodt-Harper Exhibit 6     12:40:27    9          marked for identification.)               12:40:27    io    QUESTIONS BY MR.

That's fair.                      12:42:43    Q.     Okay.

I believe so, yes.                 12:45:04    3          Q.     Okay. And then at other           12:45:07    4    times � I believe the name you referenced      12:45:14    5    before was Todd?                               12:45:15    6                  I'm sorry, who �                 12:45:17    7                  MR.

Who did you report to after        12:45:19    11    JoAnneLevy?                                  12:45:21    12          A.     Tom Berry.                        12:45:21    13          Q.     Tom Berry. Thank you.             12:45:22    14          A.     Yeah.                             12:45:24    15          Q.     So Mr. Berry, would you agree      12:45:24    16    that after � once you began reporting to       12:45:26    17    Mr. Berry, would you say that Mr. Berry was     12:45:31    18    the team leader for the SOM team?               12:45:34    19          A.     No.                               12:45:36    20          Q.     Okay. At the time that you        12:45:36    21    reported to Mr. Berry, would you say that you   12:45:37    22    were the team leader of the SOM team?           12:45:39    23          A.     So I'm sorry to repeat, but        12:45:41    24    there was no designated leader except in the    12:45:47    25    case of JoAnne Levy, who was the senior         12:45:49    Page 215    1          isolation. We were members of the        12:44:20    2          team, and we were the representatives     12:44:21    3          of the DEA compliance group on the        12:44:22    4          team, but there were others on the        12:44:25    5          team.                                   12:44:26    6    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                           12:44:26    7          Q.     Okay. But you guys were � is     12:44:26    8    it fair to say that you were the team leaders   12:44:30    9    of the SOM team, or do you disclaim that        12:44:31    10    responsibility?                               12:44:34    11          A.     I-                              12:44:34    12                  MR. O'CONNOR: Objection to        12:44:34    13          form.                                   12:44:35    14                  THE WITNESS: The leader of the    12:44:35    15          team was always the most senior           12:44:43    16          official, so in one case it was JoAnne    12:44:44    17          Levy. So I was a key contributor to      12:44:47    18          the team, as was Eileen, but I don't      12:44:50    19          know that I was ever designated as the    12:44:52    20          team leader.                             12:44:53    21    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                           12:44:54    22          Q.     Okay. So is it your testimony     12:44:54    23    that you believe, as least as of the time       12:44:56    24    that JoAnne Levy was your direct report, that   12:44:58    25    she was the team leader of the SOM policy and   12:45:02    Page 217    1    official. Tom Berry was not as actively        12:45:52    2    involved in the team because he was new to      12:45:55 the controlled substances business, and so I    12:45:58 would not state anyone's name specifically      12:46:01 during this time period as the leader.          12:46:03    Q.     Separate and apart of whether      12:46:04    7    or not there was an official designation, did   12:46:11    8    you consider yourself, along with Eileen        12:46:13    9    Spaulding, to the team leader of implementing   12:46:18    10    an improved SOM program during the 2008 time    12:46:20    11    period?                                     12:46:23    12          A.     Yes. I would consider it         12:46:23    13    controlled substances compliance               12:46:25    14    responsibility, and I was the leader of that    12:46:26    15    group at that time, yes.                      12:46:28    16          Q.     Okay. You thank.                 12:46:29 And this document indicates a      12:46:31    deadline. Do you see that?                   12:46:36    A.     I do see it.                     12:46:37    Q.     And the deadline, according to     12:46:43    21    this document, is fourth quarter 2008 fiscal    12:46:46    22    year?                                       12:46:50    23          A.     Yes.                            12:46:50    24          Q.     By the way, what was              12:46:50    25    Mallinckrodt's fiscal year?    12:46:52    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 55 (214 - 217)     Case: fti^huuy-                                          0?{&&p7&^�diSmgi&�im�ev,    1          A.     At that time it ended in    2    October � September.    3          Q.     September. Okay.    4                 So it was at least as of the    5    date of this call and the notes that were    6    drafted pursuant to this call that an    Page 218 12:46:53 12:46:57 12:46:58 12:47:02    12:47:05 12:47:10    7    improved SOM program would be complete no       12:47:15    8    later than October of 2008?                   12:47:18    9                 MR.

KO:                          12:47:20    Q.     Is that accurate or is that �     12:47:21 A.     No.                             12:47:21    Q.     That's incorrect?                 12:47:22    A.     That's incorrect.                 12:47:23    Q.     Okay. So what is this deadline    12:47:24    referring to?                                12:47:25    A.     The update that would be          12:47:26    12:47:27    21          Q.     Okay. So it wasn't necessarily    12:47:29    22    your goal to complete the SOM revisions by      12:47:31    23    fourth quarter of 2008?                       12:47:35    24          A.     No.                             12:47:36    25          Q.     Okay. Did you have a - did       12:47:36    Page 220    1          A.     Yes. Well, we reported to         12:48:53    2    JoAnne Levy, yes.                              12:48:55    3                  MR. KO: Okay. And with that,     12:48:59    4          I think we can break for lunch.           12:49:00    5                  THE WITNESS: Okay.                12:49:02    6                  VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off    12:49:02    7          the record at 12:49 p.m.                  12:49:03    8            (Off the record at 12:49 p.m.)           12:49:04    9                  (Mallinckrodt-Harper Exhibit 7     13:37:59    10          marked for identification.)               13:36:59    11                  VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on      13:36:59    12          the record at 1:37 p.m.                   13:37:01    13    QUESTIONS BY MR.

Thank you.                        13:37:07    17          Q.     I appreciate your patience to      13:37:07    18    stay. We've got a few more hours to go.        13:37:09    19                  I've handed you a copy of          13:37:12    2 0   what's been marked as Harper Exhibit 7.    13:37:14    21                  And for the record, this           13:37:16    22    document ends in Bates 274572.                  13:37:17    23                  And this is a July 29, 2008,       13:37:21    24    e-mail from you to Mr. Ratliff; is that         13:37:25    25    correct?                                      13:37:27    Page 219    1    you have a firm goal at any point in time       12:47:41    2    other than trying to effectuate an improved     12:47:43    3    SOM program as soon as possible?               12:47:46    4          A.     No.                              12:47:47    5          Q.     Okay. By the way, turning back    12:47:48    6    to the first page, there are a list of         12:47:54    7    attendees.                                    12:48:00    8                 Are all those people folks on      12:48:02    9    the DEA/controUed substance compliance team?   12:48:06    10          A.     No.                              12:48:10    11          Q.     Okay. Which individuals were      12:48:11    12    not on the DEA compliance team?                12:48:13    13          A.     JoeRuffino.                      12:48:15    14          Q.     Okay.                            12:48:23    15          A.     And I can't be certain about       12:48:23    16    Patti Woznick. So Patti and Joe were in        12:48:27    17   purchasing, and dotted line, Hobart    12:48:30    18    compliance reported to Patti for a while, and   12:48:34    19    then they came into part of this               12:48:37    20    synchronized, coordinated group. So Patti      12:48:42    21    may or may not have been part of the team at    12:48:45    22    the time.                                    12:48:48    23          Q.     Okay. So other than Joe and       12:48:48    24    potentially Patti, everyone else was a member   12:48:50    25    of the DEA compliance team?                    12:48:52    Page 221    1          A.     Yes.                              13:37:27    2          Q.     And this appears to be another     13:37:27    3    monthly report as of July 2008 that you are     13:37:29    4    sending on that we discussed previously         13:37:32    5    today?                                         13:37:35    6          A.     Correct.                           13:37:35    7          Q.     In terms of we had discussed       13:37:36    8    the fact that you had sent monthly reports to   13:37:38    9    Mr. Ratliff.                                   13:37:42    10                  And I just wanted to ask a few     13:37:43    11    questions on this document.                     13:37:45    12                  It appears here on the third       13:37:46    13    section down that you are working on a draft    13:37:48    14    of the SOM policy, and you indicate that        13:37:56    15    hopefully the final draft is close to           13:38:02    16    publication.                                   13:38:04    17                  Do you see that?                   13:38:05    18          A.     I do see it.                       13:38:05    19          Q.     Is it accurate to say as of        13:38:06    20    July 29, 2008, you're working on a final        13:38:07    21    revised draft of the SOM policy?                13:38:10    22          A.     Yes, as it stood at the time,      13:38:14    23    yes.                                           13:38:16    24          Q.

Yes.                             13:38:30    6          Q.     Okay. So at this point it's       13:38:31    7    still a work in progress, the revised SOM       13:38:32    8    program, correct?                             13:38:35    9                 MR. O'CONNOR: Objection to        13:38:36    10          form.                                   13:38:36    11                 THE WITNESS: Yes. Yes.           13:38:36    12    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                          13:38:38    13          Q.     And at the bottom of this          13:38:38    14    e-mail, there's another reference to            13:38:44    15    IntegriChain. I don't want to ask you any      13:38:45    16    questions about that. We've talked about       13:38:49    17    that.                                        13:38:50    18                 But you also discuss in this       13:38:50    19    e-mail how, quote, ""How review of              13:38:53    2 0    Mallinckrodt chargebacks could be used to       13:38:55    21    help our customers monitor their customers,""    13:38:57    22    end quote.                                   13:39:01    23                 Did I read that correctly?         13:39:01    24          A.     Yes.                             13:39:02    25          Q.     So fair-well, as of the date    13:39:02    Page 224    1    Mallinckrodt to begin with.                     13:40:20    2                  So then in that circumstance,      13:40:21    3    the distributor applies back to Mallinckrodt    13:40:23    4    to made whole � to be made whole for that      13:40:25    5    differential. So I'd like to point out that    13:40:28    6    all transactions are not subject to             13:40:32    7    chargebacks, and chargebacks are after the      13:40:34    8    fact, retrospective information.                13:40:36    9          Q.     And when you say ""all              13:40:39    10    transactions are not subject to chargebacks,""   13:40:41    11    what you mean by that, if I understand you      13:40:44    12    correctly, is that, you know, chargeback only   13:40:47    13    occurs if a distributor or customer of          13:40:49    14    Mallinckrodt makes such a request to            13:40:50    15    Mallinckrodt, correct?                         13:40:52    16          A.     Correct.                           13:40:53    17          Q.     Pursuant to the terms of the       13:40:53    18    agreement between the distributor and           13:40:56    19    Mallinckrodt, correct?                         13:40:58    20          A.     That's correct.                    13:40:58    21          Q.     Okay. And separate and apart      13:40:59    22    from whether or not all information, as you     13:41:01    23    describe, is contained in the chargeback        13:41:05    24    information--or chargeback data, for lack     13:41:07    25    of a better term, was there also a certain      13:41:09    Page 223    1    of this e-mail, is it fair to say that you      13:39:06    2    were considering how to utilize chargeback      13:39:10    3    information to understand how to help           13:39:12    4    customers monitor their customers?              13:39:16    5           A.     Yes, that's correct.               13:39:18    6          Q.     Okay. You can set that aside.     13:39:19    7                  And was one reason to utilize      13:39:22    8    chargeback information � or strike that.       13:39:39    9                  What is your understanding of      13:39:41    10    chargeback � chargeback data, separate and     13:39:43    11    apart from what's included in that?             13:39:47    12           A.     Like currently my -               13:39:48    13           Q.     Yeah. What's your                 13:39:50    14    understanding of what chargeback data           13:39:51    15    consists of.                                   13:39:54    16          A.

The downstream registrants   13:40:12 2 4    purchase from our distributor at a lesser       13:40:14 25    price than the distributor has paid             13:40:19    Page 225    1    point in time where you expanded the            13:41:12    2    examination of, quote/unquote, downstream       13:41:17    3    data?                                         13:41:22    4                  MR.

When the wholesaler honors   13:43:27    4    the discounted price to the pharmacy, they      13:43:30    5    then submit a chargeback request               13:43: 32    6    retroactively to Mallinckrodt so that they      13:43:35    7    can be made financially whole for the           13:43: 39    8    difference in price.""                         13:43:41    9                 Is that enough or shall I go       13:43:44    10    on?                                          13:43:46    11          Q.

I'm not certain.                   13:49:07    4          Q.     Okay. Generally speaking, was     13:49:12    5    it Mr. Rausch's responsibility to send these    13:49:13    6    reports to the DEA monthly ?                    13:49: 14    7          A.     Yes.                              13:49:15    8          Q.     Okay. And do you have an          13:49:16    9    understanding of � well, earlier we were       13:49:19    10    talking about the distinction between           13:49:22    11    peculiar and suspicious orders.                 13:49:24    12                  Do you recall that?                13:49:25    13          A.     Yes.                              13:49:25    14          Q.     Is it your understanding that      13:49:26    15    these monthly reports being sent by             13:49:27    16    Mr. Rausch were a compilation of the peculiar   13:49:31    17    orders that Mallinckrodt had identified?        13:49:34    18          A.     Yes.                              13:49:36    19          Q.     Okay. So in other words, it       13:49:38    20    wasn't necessarily the case that they were �   13:49:40    21    that Mallinckrodt was sending any               13:49:42    22    notification of suspicious orders to DEA,       13:49:44    23    correct?                                      13:49:46    24          A.     Correct.                          13:49:46    25          Q.

Correct.                           13:49:53    4           Q.     Okay. And do you recall - I      13:49:54    5    know I've asked this question in another form   13:50:08    6    or in a different way, but do you recall        13:50:11    7    prior to December 5, 2007, whether or not       13:50:13    8    Mallinckrodt had ever identified a suspicious   13:50:16    9    order to the DEA?                              13:50:18    10           A.     Yes, I do recall.                  13:50:20    11           Q.     You do recall instances in         13:50:22    12    which Mallinckrodt identified a suspicious      13:50:24    13    order to the DEA?                              13:50:26    14           A.     Yes.                              13:50:26    15           Q.     Okay. And when did that occur?    13:50:27    16          A.     So there was the case we talked    13:50:28    17    about with the compounding pharmacy.            13:50:31    18           Q.     Okay.                             13:50:34    19          A.     And there were several others,     13:50:35    20    but I don't recall the particulars of those     13:50:38    21    reports.                                       13:50:40    22           Q.     Fair enough.                       13:50:41    23                  So you do recall some instances    13:50:41    24    in which suspicious orders were reported to     13:50:45    25    Mallinckrodt prior to December 14, 2007?        13:50:48    Page 236    1    sending reports as well, but the confirmed      13:51:41    2    suspicious orders to DEA were ten or less.      13:51:45    3          Q.     Right.                           13:51:46    4                 And as we discussed, the           13:51:47    5    report � the monthly reports were just the     13:51:49    6    peculiar orders that Mallinckrodt had           13:51:50    7    identified, correct?                          13:51:52    8          A.     Correct.                         13:51:52    9          Q.     And not necessarily any � or      13:51:53    10   not any suspicious orders, correct?    13:51:55    11          A.     Correct.                         13:51:57    12          Q.     Okay. By the way, there's         13:51:58    13    reference made to someone by the name of Sean   13:52:07    14    Welch.                                       13:52:10    15                 Do you see that?                  13:52:10    16          A.     Yes.                             13:52:11    17          Q.     Who is he?                        13:52:12    18          A.     He was a co-manager of customer    13:52:13    19    service at that time. I believe Jim Rausch     13:52:19    20    may have reported to him.                      13:52:22    21          Q.     Okay. Was he involved on the      13:52:25    22    SOM team as well?                             13:52:27    23          A.     Only in terms of being kept        13:52:28    24    informed of our activity.                      13:52:36    25          Q.     So he didn't have any             13:52:37    Page 235    1          A.     Reported to the DEA?               13:50:52    2          Q.

But this was     13:58:23    12    not � it quotes the regulations, but this      13:58:27    13    was not promulgated in CFR 21.                  13:58:30    14          Q.     I understand that and I - I       13:58:34    15    very clearly under the distinction Eat         13:58:35    16    you're trying to make, and my question simply   13:58:37    17    was whether or not you believed you were        13:58:39    18    expected to comply with the instructions set    13:58:42    19    forth in that letter.                          13:58:45    20                  MR.

And I understand the               14:00:26    5    distinction being made, but there were          14:00:28    6    certain statements made in Southwood,           14:00:30    7    correct, as we discussed earlier?               14:00:32    8           A.

And in this e-mail chain, I        14:04:20    5    believe you're asking what the algorithm �     14:04:24    6    you're asking Mr. Rausch what the algorithm     14:04:29    7    is to determine orders of excessive quantity,   14:04:31    8    frequency or outside of the normal pattern;     14:04:36    9    is that correct?                               14:04:38    10          A.     Yes.                              14:04:38    11          Q.

Well, let me just make sure the    14:05:05    22    record is clear.                               14:05:06    23                  His response to your question      14:05:06    24    is, quote, ""Any order quantity that is^^^]   14:05:08    25    Ee previous fiscal year and YTD"" -- in other   14:05:09    1   what the current one is �    Page 252 14:05:50 Sure.                             14:05:52    -at that time.                   14:05:52    I see what you're saying.          14:05:52    Okay.                             14:05:54    And so my question was simply:     14:05:54    7    At the time of this e-mail, you did not know    14:05:56    8    the then current equation to determine a        14:05:59 peculiar order, correct?                       14:06:02    A.     That's correct.                    14:06:03    Q.     And based on your e-mail, you      14:06:04 had thought that perhaps it was just a 1.2    13    metric?                                        14:06:09    14                  MR.

Okay.                  14:06:14    19                  And just, again, to be clear,      14:06:17    20    this--this e-mail talks about an excessive    14:06:19    21    quantity calculation. That's the title of      14:06:22    22    the e-mail, right?                             14:06:25    23          A.     Yes.                              14:06:26    24          Q.     And Mallinckrodt's then system     14:06:27    25    to determine whether or not an order was of     14:06:36    Page 251    1    words, year-to-date � ""average for a SKU and   14:05:13    2    customer.""                                    14:05:15    3                  Did I read Eat correctly?         14:05:16    4          A.     Yes.                              14:05:16    5          Q.     Okay. And so does this refresh    14:05:17    6    your recollection that in the April 2008 time   14:05:21    7    period, the algorithm that you were using for   14:05:23    8    the peculiar order threshold was Q the         14:05:24    9    previous fiscal year?                          14:05:26    10          A.     Yes.                              14:05:27    11          Q.     Okay. And at that time, it's      14:05:28    12    also fair to say based on this e-mail that      14:05:30    13    you didn't actually know until Jim responded    14:05:32    14    what the formula actually was?                 14:05:35    15                  MR.

KO:                           14:05:39    20          Q.     Well, why did you ask him Een?    14:05:40    21          A.     Because I asked Ee current        14:05:42    22    equation. It had moved fromQ tdfl tofl     14:05:44    23    It moved around.                               14:05:47    24          Q.     Right.                            14:05:48    25          A.     The multiplier. So I asked him    14:05:48    Page 253    1    an excessive quantity, frequency or outside     14:06:39    2    of normal pattern was to use EeQ metric      14:06:42    3    that we've been describing today; is that       14:06:45    4    correct?                                       14:06:47    5          A.     Yes.                              14:06:47    6          Q.     Okay. You can set that aside.     14:06:49    7                  Now, the date of this e-mail is    14:07:02    8    April 21, 2008, correct?                        14:07:03    9          A.     Yes, correct.                      14:07:05    10          Q.     And that's approximately three     14:07:07    11    and a half months after you received            14:07:08    12    notification from the DEA, and in particular    14:07:10    13    the second Rannazzisi letter, correct?          14:07:14    14          A.     Yes.                              14:07:17    15          Q.     So is it fair to say that it       14:07:17    16    took you three and a half months to ask         14:07:18    17    Mr. Rausch what your then existing peculiar     14:07:21    18    order algorithm metric was ?                     14: 07: 24    19                  MR.

And do you know whether     14:25:37    22    or not Eose - and I Eink earlier I had       14:25:38    23    said ""peculiar, suspicious, peculiar,"" but I    14:25:40    24    mean to say ""particular suspicious.""            14:25:42    25          A.     That's how the sentence reads.     14:25:43    Page 273    1    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                          14:26:30    2          Q.     Okay.

In 2012.                         14:26:37    6          Q.     Okay. So Eat would be four       14:26:41    7    years after the date of Eis particular         14:26:44    8    e-mail, correct?                              14:26:48    9          A.     Correct.                         14:26:48    10          Q.     Do you know why it took so         14:26:49    11    along to enact Eat policy?                    14:26:51    12          A.     So we were working on enhancing    14:26:53    13    our program again. I keep stating that.        14:26:56    14                 These are suggestions by           14:27:00    15    breakout speakers and not necessarily � she    14:27:03    16    talks about Eey're not all-inclusive,          14:27:06    17    they're for informational purposes.             14:27:09    18                 So it was our intent to do so,     14:27:10    19    but we had not completely incorporated Ee      14:27:13    20    explanation into every order that was           14:27:17    21    reviewed at that time.                        14:27:19    22          Q.     But you - excuse me. You did     14:27:21    23    ultimately adopt a system whereby you           14:27:25    24    formally documented every peculiar and          14:27:27    25    suspicious order in 2012, correct?             14:27:29    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 69 (270 - 273)     Case: ^TTS^-WR^i^^tR^#^^3i^B^o 0?{&&2k$^�diSmgi&�18&Lev,    Page 274    1          A.     Yes.                             14:27:31    2          Q.     And Eafs four years after you    14:27:32    3    first discussed the possibility of doing so,    14:27:33    4    correct?                                     14:27:35    5          A.     If s four years after Ee topic    14:27:36    6    was made � mentioned at a conference, yes.     14:27:38    7          Q.     And reference was made by          14:27:40    8    Ms. Stewart that ""we must also formally         14:27:44    9    document.""                                    14:27:47    10                 Did I read that correctly?         14:27:47    11                 So just the record�just so      14:27:56    12    Ee record is clear, Ms. Stewart indicates in   14:27:57    13    her notes Eat, quote, ""We must also formally   14:28:00    14    document the investigation of each particular   14:28:04    15    suspicious, open parens, peculiar, close        14:28:09    16    parens, order that gets identified,"" end        14:28:11    17    quote.                                       14:28:15    18                 Did I read that correctly?         14:28:15    19          A.     Yes, you did.                     14:28:15    20          Q.     Okay. So as of the fall           14:28:16    21    of 2008, she is suggesting, is she not, that    14:28:21    22    you must formally document each suspicious or   14:28:23    23    peculiar order?                               14:28:25    24          A.     She is relaying Eose notes        14:28:25    25    from Ee conference, not necessarily as a       14:28:29    Page 276    i    QUESTIONS BY MR.

And as we described earlier,       14:29:07    3    there weren't necessarily other                 14:29:10    4    extracurricular activities that you were        14:29:12    5    involved in with respect to your diversion      14:29:14    6    responsibilities at Mallinckrodt, correct?      14:29:16    7                  MR.

And so this conference was an      14:29:19    12    important conference for you to attend in       14:29:21    13    which you could further understand your         14:29:23    14    responsibilities under the CSA, correct?        14:29:25    15                  MR.

So is it fair to say that the      14:29:29    20    advice and suggestions that were borne out of   14:29:31    21    this conference were important suggestions to   14:29:34    22    follow?                                        14:29:38    23                  MR.

Not necessarily. She's            14:28:44    10    relaying comments made at a conference by a     14:28:45    11    speaker.                                      14:28:47    12          Q.

Yes.                              14:48:27    14          Q.     Okay. And the question is         14:48:28    15    asked, ""Are there any plans for DEA to          14:48:31    16    publicize information to implement?""            14:48:35    17                  Do you see that?                   14:48:37    18          A.

Sure.                             14:47:08    2                  And there are notes. I just       14:47:09    3    want to turn to the first page of notes that    14:47:11    4    he drafts. These appear to be notes that he    14:47:17    5    has created following his attendance at the     14:47:20    6    2009 Buzzeo conference; is that correct?        14:47:24    7           A.     Yes.                              14:47:25    8           Q.     And looking down at the bottom     14:47:28    9    of this page, he indicates where I'm            14:47:32    10    highlighting right now, ""Sir, suspicious        14:47:34    11    order monitoring was certainly a hotbed of      14:47:37    12    discussion.""                                   14:47:39    13                  Do you see that?                   14:47:40    14           A.     So that's a question, yes,         14:47:40    15    that's a question as documented here.           14:47:44    16          Q.     Right.                            14:47:45    17                  And if s a question by someone     14:47:46    18    in the audience, some registrant or someone     14:47:47    19    who attended the conference, correct?           14:47:50    20           A.

And so if s fair to say     14:47:52    22    that as of the fall of 2009, their              14:47:57    23    continual � there's continual attention and    14:48:01    24    scrutiny being given to Mallinckrodt's          14:48:02    25    suspicious order monitoring system?             14:48:05    Page 297 given by someone at DEA, it appears.            14:48:51    Do you see Eat?                  14:48:54    A.     Yes.                             14:48:54    Q.     And that's Jim Crawford.           14:48:55    Did you know who he has?           14:48:57    A.     Yes.                             14:48:59    Q.     Okay. Did you communicate with    14:49:00 him at all during the 2008, 2012 time period?   14:49:01 A.     No.                              14:49:04    Q.     Okay. But you just knew � you    14:49:05 just knew who he was, but you didn't           14:49:08    necessarily communicate with him?              14:49:10    A.     Correct. He and Mark Caverly      14:49:11 spoke at the end of every Buzzeo conference.    14:49:15 Q.     Got it.                          14:49:16    And it's � he says in response    14:49:17 to this question, quote, ""Whatever we put out   14:49:20 will be outdated by Ee time we put it out.     14:49:24 You're looking at a number.

Correct.                         15:16:56    21          Q.

And the - by the way,      15:27:18    3    in this chronology Eat you drafted, you        15:27:36    4    represented to Eileen that this was an          15:27:40    5    attempt by you to provide an extensive          15:27:44    6    chronology on SOM activities during this        15:27:49    7    two-year time period.                          15:27:52    8                  Why were you providing this to     15:27:52    9    her?                                          15:27:56    10          A.     I was assigned at the St. Louis    15:27:56    11    plant, working in the plant during a work       15:27:57    12    stoppage which had gone on for an extended      15:28:00    13    period of time, months, and so I wanted to      15:28:04    14    update Eileen on the status of the current      15:28:07    15    system of enhancements.                        15:28:10    16          Q.     Okay. And do you recall           15:28:11    17    whether or not you may have provided this to    15:28:13    18    her in preparation for any meetings that she    15:28:15    19    was having with DEA?                           15:28:18    20          A.     I don't recall.                   15:28:19    21          Q.     Okay. And you did reference a     15:28:23    22    work stoppage at Mallinckrodt. I understand    15:28:26    23    that there was a strike by some employees at    15:28:29    24    Covidien at the time.                          15:28:31    25          A.     Is Eat referenced here?           15:28:31    Page 320    1    report to Ms. Spaulding, do you?                15:29:25    2          A.     I do not.                          15:29:26    3          Q.     Okay. And by the way, what was    15:29:29    4    the approximate date of the strike?             15:29:30    5          A.     It was in 2010, and I believe      15:29:31    6    it would have started in March or April         15:29:38    7    because our union contract's due in March,      15:29:39    8    but I think they had an extension until         15:29:43    9    April. So I'm not � around that time.         15:29:45    10          Q.     Okay. Great.                      15:29:48    11                  And it lasted until May or June    15:29:49    12    of 2010?                                       15:29:54    13          A.     Or longer. I can't -             15:29:54    14          Q.     Sure.                             15:29:57    15          A.     I can't remember when it was       15:29:57    16    over.                                          15:29:58    17          Q.     Sure.                             15:29:58    18                  Turn to page 4 of this report,     15:29:59    19    this chronology. There's a reference made      15:30:02    20    that on April 30, 2010, the peculiar order      15:30:11    21    calculations changed from a^^factor to aQ   15:30:14    22    factor.                                        15:30:18    23                  Do you see that reference?         15:30:20    24          A.     I do.                             15:30:21    25          Q.     So if I understand correctly,      15:30:22    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    10    11    12    13    14    Page 319    Q-    A.    Q-    A.    Q-    s --    A.    Q-    I don't think it is. Okay.    Yeah, but � All right.    15:28:33 15:28:34    15:28:34 15:28:34    � just � just generally Eere    15:28:35    15:28:35 Yes, you're correct. Yes.         15:28:35    There was a strike by Covidien     15:28:37    employees in the 2010 time period.              15:28:39    How long did that last?            15:28:41    A.     17 weeks, I believe.               15:28:42    Q.     Okay. A fairly long strike.       15:28:51 A.     (Witness nods head.)               15:28:52    Q.     And during that time period,       15:28:53    15    was there any work done on attempting to        15:28:54    16    improve or revise the SOM process?              15:28:56    17          A.     Yes.                              15:29:00    18          Q.     And who was that work done by?     15:29:01    19          A.     So the work was ongoing, with      15:29:03    20    Jim Rausch working with IT on the algorithms,   15:29:06    21    so other subcomponents of Ee team continued    15:29:10    22    while I was away.                              15:29:13    23          Q.     Okay. And with respect to this    15:29:15    24    chronology, you have no reason to dispute the   15:29:17    25    accuracy of any of these events that you        15:29:21    Page 321    1    the peculiar order algorithm on April 30,       15:30:27    2    2010, increased from ?to Q, correct?         15:30:30    3          A.     That's correct.                   15:30:36    4          Q.     So in other words, as of April     15:30:36    5    30, 2010, the algorithm that Mallinckrodt       15:30:38    6    utilized to determine wheEer or not an order   15:30:42    7    was suspicious was by determining whether an    15:30:44    8    order was^^^^^^ greater Ean the prior    15:30:50    9    year average; is that accurate?                15:30:54    10          A.     Yes.                             15:30:57    11          Q.     Okay. And this increase           15:30:58    12    resulted for a variety of reasons, is my        15:31:04    13    understanding, but is one of Ee reasons Eat   15:31:08    14    you increased from ^^to Q because Ee         15:31:11    15    peculiar order report was too lengthy?          15:31:14    16                 MR.

KO:                          15:31:20    20          Q.     So it was creating an             15:31:21    21    administrative burden because there were too    15:31:22 2 2    many orders to review ?                        15:31: 25    23                 MR.

That's correct, and Ee hope       15:31:45    8    was Eat Ee truly � the orders Eat needed    15:31:47    9    to be investigated further would Een print     15:31:50    10    based upon Eis new change in Ee algoriEm.    15:31:54    11          Q.

The group decided that, yes.       15:40:50    13          Q.     Okay. And did you in fact         15:40:52    14    implement this policy change?                  15:40:53    15          A.

To Ee extent they were     15:43:36    10    compensated based on Ee volume of pills        15:43:40    11    purchased by their customers, would you agree   15:43:46    12    that that would be a conflict of interest -    15:43:48    13                 MR.

They were consulted or       15:46:29    10          rose situations to our attention.         15:46:31    11    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                            15:46:33    12          Q.     I understand that that was         15:46:34    13    the--what happened after this e-mail, or      15:46:34    14    that change was attempted to be made. But      15:46:37    15    prior to the date of this, you are              15:46:40    16    indicating, are you not, in this e-mail that    15:46:46    17    a conflict of interest exists with respect to   15:46:47    18    the customer service group?                     15:46:49    19          A.     It does state - yes, it does      15:46:51    20    state that.                                    15:46:59    21          Q.     And you said also that national    15:46:59    22    account managers have involvement in � in      15:47:01    23    Mallinckrodt customers as well, right?          15:47:04    24          A.     Correct.                           15:47:06    25          Q.     And that approximately four to     15:47:07    Page 335    1    interest that you're referring to there?        15:45:10    2           A.     It's a � you know, it's just a    15:45:11    3    conglomeration of even though customer          15:45:12    4    service is separate from the NAMs and           15:45:16    5    separate from commercial, customer service      15:45:20    6    does maintain a relationship with the           15:45:22    7    customers. And so that's the basis on which    15:45:24    8    this statement was made.                        15:45:26    9          Q.     Well, how - how was it any        15:45:28    10    different � how was the conflict of interest   15:45:34    11    that applies with respect to the customer       15:45:36    12    service group any different than a conflict     15:45:38    13    of interest that would apply with respect to    15:45:40    14    the national account managers?                  15:45:43    15           A.     So customer service group          15:45:44    16    maintained the relationship with the            15:45:51    17    customer, as did the NAMs.                      15:45:53    18                  Could you repeat that question,    15:45:55    19    please?

Yes.                            16:00:30    15          Q.     And you indicate Eat, quote,      16:00:31    16    ""We have significant gaps in Eat although      16:00:35    17    CDIG send out Ee annual update SOM customer    16:00:40    18    checklist, when Ee system indicates customer   16:00:44    19    account DEA registration is nearing renewal     16:00:48    20    time, Eey do nothing if Ee SOM customer       16:00:51    21    checklist is not ever retained by Ee          16:00:54    22    customer.""                                   16:00:56    23                 Did I read Eat correctly?         16:00:57    24          A.     Yes.                            16:00:57    25          Q.     Okay. And CDIG basically -       16:00:59    Page 352    1          A.     Yes.                              16:01:47    2          Q.     And in some instances, you         16:01:48    3    never actually in fact received the             16:01:50    4    checklist, correct?                            16:01:53    5          A.     I believe this says during the     16:01:53    6    renewal.                                       16:01:56    7          Q.     Yeah.                             16:01:58    8                  During the renewal time period,    16:01:59    9    CDIG does nothing if the SOM customer           16:02:01    10    checklist is ever returned; is that correct?    16:02:05    11          A.     So customers would have sent in    16:02:07    12    an initial checklist, but then this is the      16:02:13    13    annual update that they may not have turned     16:02:17    14    in, and CDIG may not have caught that fact,     16:02:19    15    yes.                                           16:02:20    16          Q.

If that doesn't - or if you       16:08:42    7    don't mind.                                  16:08:44    8          A.

For the record, this e-mail        16:08:53    11    exchange ends in Bates 500657. And this is     16:08:54    12    an e-mail exchange from actually Ee 2009 to    16:08:59    13    2010 time period.                            16:09:04    14                 And the title of Ee e-mail is     16:09:08    15    ""Chargeback Information Request.""              16:09:09    16                 Do you see that?                 16:09:10    17          A.

But if you look at the      16:09:22    22    bottom of Ee second page, Eere is an e-mail   16:09:24    23    from you to Tiffany Rowley dated November 19,   16:09:27    24    2009.                                       16:09:33    25                 Do you see that?                 16:09:33    Page 361    1                  MR.

I cannot say if we did or did      16:51:25    15    not.                                           16:51:26    16          Q.     Okay. Harvard Drug � do you      16:51:27    17    recall when Harvard Drug had its license        16:51:41    18    suspended by the DEA?                          16:51:44    19          A.     2010 or before, around that        16:51:45    20    time.                                          16:51:51    21           Q.     Okay.

But if you look at          16:53:39    3    Florida percent POs � do you see that?         16:53:40    4          A.     Ida                            16:53:43    5          Q.     Okay. And is that - in Ee       16:53:44    6    chargeback data, you had been able to           16:53:47    7    determine what percentage of purchase orders    16:53:51    8    went to Florida, correct?                      16:53:55    9          A.

Wasn't it Ee case Eat     16:54:02    13    through the chargeback data you knew you        16:54:08    14    could understand, as we discussed earlier,      16:54:11    15    where the pills that you sold to the            16:54:13    16    distributors were going?                       16:54:16    17          A.     Yes, but in this context, I        16:54:17    18    believe the purchase order to be the purchase   16:54:20    19    order from Harvard to Mallinckrodt as the       16:54:22    20    supplier, not forward through the supply        16:54:25    21    chain.                                       16:54:27    22          Q.     Okay. So it's your               16:54:27    23    understanding Eat this is just � well,        16:54:28    24    Harvard Drug, do you know where they were       16:54:32    25    located?                                     16:54:35    Page 383    1                  TIJE WITNESS: Yes.                 16:52:08    2    QUIESTIONS BY MR. KO:                           16:52:10    3          Q.     Okay. And would you agree with    16:52:10    4    me that First Vet Supply is not a physician     16:52:25    5    or a pain clinic?                              16:52:30    6          A.     I don't know their business        16:52:32    7    model. I don't � is their DEA registration    16:52:34    8    number the same as Harvard Drug Group?          16:52:38    9          Q.     I believe that to be the case,     16:52:42    10    actually.                                     16:52:44    11          A.     So, many of our distributors       16:52:44    12    had d/b/a second lines, and that's a � my      16:52:54    13    understanding is a legal term implying the      16:52:57    14    organization of a corporation. So I only       16:52:59    15    knew this customer as Harvard Drug.             16:53:01    16          Q.     Okay. Setting aside the name,     16:53:03    17    did you understand that a large percentage of   16:53:10    18    drugs sold by Harvard Drug were going to        16:53:15    19    Florida? And in particular, I direct you to    16:53:18    20    the percentages that appear in the middle of    16:53:28    21    the screen that show Florida percentage.        16:53:24    22          A.     So total POs doesn't tell me       16:53:28    23    number of drugs. They could have been          16:53:30    24    purchase orders for a hundred drugs or 10,000   16:53:33    25    dosage units, so I can't � I don't have        16:53:35    Page 385    1          A.     I believe Wisconsin.               16:54:35    2          Q.     Okay. I think they were in        16:54:37    3    Michigan, but somewhere in the Midwest.         16:54:40    4          A.     All right.                         16:54:42    5          Q.     So you're saying that this is      16:54:42    6    the percentage of initial pills that go to      16:54:43    7    the distributor?                               16:54:47    8          A.     Again, these are purchase          16:54:48    9    orders. They could have been for 100 pills     16:54:51    10    or a million pills. I don't have enough        16:54:55    11    information to answer the question.             16:54:57    12          Q.     Okay. Turn to the second page     16:54:58    13    of this document. And so these � these        16:55:06    14    columns, by the way, are taken straight from    16:55:14    15    the--I'll represent to you that they're       16:55:16    16    taken straight from the chargeback reports      16:55:18    17    that are reflected by this Bates number.        16:55:22    18                  And if you see on the far          16:55:25    19    right-hand side above the oxy 15 and oxy 30     16:55:27    20    sections, do you see the reference to UOM?      16:55:30    21          A.     I do.                             16:55:34    22          Q.     And what's your understanding      16:55:34    23    of UOM?                                        16:55:35    24          A.     Unit of measure.                   16:55:36    25          Q.     Okay. And would that actually     16:55:38    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 97 (382 - 385)     Case: ^TTS^-WR^i^^tR^#^^3^B^o 0?{&&$^^�diSmgi&1r2W&.ev,    Page 386    1    be synonymous wiE, for example, a pill?        16:55:40    2          A.     Yes.                              16:55:44    3          Q.     So that's the actual amount of     16:55:45    4    pills that are being shipped for that           16:55:47    5    particular order, correct?                     16:55:51    6          A.     It - this is a monthly total,     16:55:53    7    so, yes, if we're � yes, I'm sorry, I didn't   16:55:59    8    have Ee correlation to � that a PO equals     16:56:04    9    one month in � I'm just not familiar with      16:56:08    10    the spreadsheet, so, yes.                      16:56:10    11          Q.     Yeah, fair enough.                 16:56:12    12                  And on the � on this document     16:56:13    13    there's an indication also of Florida           16:56:18    14    percentage sales, quantity government UOM.      16:56:21    15                  Do you see that?                  16:56:24    16          A.     Yes.                              16:56:24    17          Q.     Do you recall Eat particular      16:56:25    18    data field in the chargeback information?       16:56:28    19          A.     Yes.                              16:56:30    20          Q.     Okay. And so does that reflect    16:56:31    21    the percentage of pills Eat went to            16:56:33    22    downstream customers of Mallinckrodt?           16:56:37    23                  MR.

And as we just discussed    17:12:09    17    a moment ago, ""effective immediately,           17:12:17    18    Mallinckrodt will no longer process             17:12:21    19    chargebacks from distributor sales of           17:12:22    20    Mallinckrodt products to the pharmacies         17:12:25    21    identified on attachment 1 hereto.""              17:12:27    22                  And those pharmacies are of        17:12:29    23    course the ones listed in the second page of    17:12:31    24    this document, correct?                         17:12:33    25           A.

I want to understand to what     17:13:33    3    extent you actually utilize IMS data to make    17:13:36    4    certain determinations as well.                 17:13:39    5          A.     Okay. We used IMS data to look    17:13:41    6    at the prescribers of oxycodone 15s and 30s.    17:13:47    7    When we spoke to the distributors about these   17:13:53    8    potentially � about these pharmacies that      17:13:57    9    displayed red flags, we asked the               17:14:00    10    distributors if they had a list of the top      17:14:04    11    prescribers that were writing RXs at these      17:14:06    12    pharmacies, and Een that was a method of       17:14:09    13    comparison that we had to this IMS data list    17:14:12    14    of the top prescribers in the country.          17:14:14    15          Q.     Okay. And when do you recall      17:14:16    16    first utilizing Ee IMS data in connection      17:14:22    17    with this review of prescriber-level            17:14:26    18    information?                                  17:14:28    19          A.     I don't know when it started.      17:14:28    20          Q.     Okay. Are you currently           17:14:30    21    utilizing IMS data in connection with your      17:14:34    22    suspicious order monitoring system?             17:14:36    23          A.

You can � I'd actually ask        17:14:56    7    that you keep that document in front of you,    17:15:08    8    but just probably you can refer to the back     17:15:09    9    because I want to ask you some questions        17:15:11    10    about these pharmacies.                        17:15:12    11          A.     All right.                        17:15:13    12                  (Mallinckrodt-Harper Exhibit 29    17:15:15    13          marked for identification.)               17:15:16    14    QUIESTIONS BY MR.

Oh, my gosh.                      17:15:30    18          Q.     And for the record, this           17:15:32    19    document ends in Bates 32384 and is an e-mail   17:15:35 2 0    from Wayne Corona at Masters to you, dated      17:15:40    21    October 10-20, 2011.                        17:15:46    22                  Do you recall this e-mail?         17:15:49    23          A.     Yes.                              17:15:50    24          Q.     Okay. This is Masters'            17:15:51    25    response to the letter Eat you had sent to     17:15:55    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 102 (402 - 405)     Case: \A�lfmi0�f&$S&n�>9�fr19�u�je^^    Page 406    1    them that we just previously discussed that     17:15:59    2    reflects Exhibit 28; is that correct?           17:16:03    3           A.     I don't see - we had a            17:16:04    4    separate letter addressed � is this in your    17:16:11    5    pile? I'm so confused.                         17:16:16    6                  Okay. We had a separate letter    17:16:18    7    addressed to Masters.                           17:16:23    8           Q.     Okay. And in that separate        17:16:23    9    letter, you were identifying --1 believe       17:16:24    10    I've seen that, but in that separate letter     17:16:29    11    you identify these same pharmacies; is that     17:16:31    12    correct?                                       17:16:32    13           A.     Yes. Yes.                         17:16:32    14           Q.     So at some point before this       17:16:34    15    e-mail, you had obviously indicated to          17:16:38    16    Masters that there were certain pharmacies      17:16:40    17    that you weren't going to honor chargebacks     17:16:48    18    to, correct?                                   17:16:52    19          A.     Yes.                              17:16:52    20           Q.     And I assume that there was a      17:16:52    21    separate e-mail sent to Masters, because at     17:16:54    22    the time you weren't doing business with        17:16:57    23    them?                                          17:16:59    24           A.     I believe this is the time we      17:17:00    25    notified Masters that we were going to          17:17:04    Page 408    1          Q.     Okay. So is it accurate to say    17:18:09    2    that what he's trying to tell you is that for   17:18:12    3    each one of these pharmacies that you have      17:18:15    4    identified as being problematic, he has         17:18:16    5    indicated that Masters has already placed       17:18:21    6    them on Masters'termination list; is that      17:18:24    7    accurate?                                      17:18:28    8          A.     Yes.                              17:18:28    9          Q.     Okay. And for several of these    17:18:29    10    pharmacies, Masters had placed these            17:18:32    11    pharmacies on the termination list              17:18:36    12    approximately one year prior to you notifying   17:18:39    13    Masters of these problematic pharmacies; is     17:18:42    14    that accurate?                                 17:18:47    15          A.     Yes.                              17:18:47    16          Q.     Okay. Now, he goes on to          17:18:48    17    say � and I recall earlier when we discussed   17:18:57    18    how you had indicated to Masters that they      17:19:01    19    had an inadequate SOM program.                  17:19: 04    20          A.     Yes.                              17:19:06    21          Q.     Okay. And he responds, quote,     17:19:07    22    ""In your last two letters to Masters, you       17:19:11    2 3    have judged our SOMs to be inadequately         17:19:16    24    robust, yet somehow we identified these         17:19:18    25    accounts well before you, exclamation point.""   17:19:20    Page 407    1    discontinue sales of Mallinckrodt product to    17:17:07    2    Masters.                                       17:17:09    3           Q.     Okay.                             17:17:10    4           A.     So it would have been a letter.    17:17:10    5                  But we sent several letters to     17:17:11    6    Masters, and so I--the content of each one    17:17:13    7    I can't attest to.                             17:17:19    8           Q.     Sure. Fair enough.                17:17:19    9                  In any event, Mr. Corona,          17:17:20    10    who � it does appear in the end of this        17:17:24    11    e-mail that he is the president of Masters      17:17:27    12    Pharmaceutical.                                17:17:29    13                  Do you see that? I've             17:17:29    14    highlighted it.                                17:17:38    15           A.     Yes, I do. Yes. Yes.             17:17:38    16          Q.     So you had sent some               17:17:39    17    correspondence to Jennifer Seiple at Masters,   17:17:42    18    and you had identified these pharmacies that    17:17:46    19    appear in attachment 1, correct?                17:17:49    20           A.     Yes.                              17:17:50    21           Q.     Okay. And he responds that ""As    17:17:51    22    you can see, the dates of termination predate   17:18:03    23    your notification.""                            17:18:06    24                  Do you see that?                   17:18:08    25           A.     I do.                             17:18:08    Page 409    1                  Did I read that correctly?         17:19:23    2          A.     Yes.                              17:19:23    3          Q.

They were - I believe that        17:23:51    19    they were the subject of a DEA indictment,      17:23:53    20    and they were a particularly problematic        17:23:55    21    customer.                                     17:23:58    22                  But regardless, in � as of        17:23:59    23    October 28, 2010, Masters had placed Gulf       17:24:03    24    Coast on their termination list, correct?       17:24:07    25                  MR.

And so assuming you had asked      17:33:48    2    them the question of whether or not Masters     17:33:50    3    had placed Island Drug on their do not ship     17:33:53    4    list, would you agree with me that it would     17:33:57    5    be indicative of an inadequate SOM program if   17:34:00    6    you continued to ship drugs to customers who    17:34:05    7    shipped to Island Drug?                        17:34:08    8                  MR.

But if we would    17:34:21    14          have known which customers Masters had    17:34:24    15          terminated, we would have put them on     17:34:26    16          our chargeback restriction list.          17:34:28    17    QUIESTIONS BY MR.

You would recommend         17:34:51    to � one of the reasons why you would not      17:34:57 honor the chargeback request is to notify the   17:34:58    7    distributor that you would not be paying Eem   17:35:01    8    the difference between the amount that they     17:35:03 agreed upon with you and the subsequent price   17:35:07 that they're receiving for the drug in the      17:35:10 downstream transaction, correct?                17:35:12    A.

And Howard Davis, as we     17:50:27    15    had discussed before, was a consultant you      17:50:29    16    had retained in connection with your SOM        17:50:31    17    program; is that correct?                      17:50:35    18          A.     Yes.                              17:50:36    19          Q.     Okay. And Howard Davis was        17:50:37    20    ex-DEA?                                       17:50:40    21          A.

And I believe he was, in           17:50:41    23    particular, a DRM.                             17:50:43    24                  Do I understand -                 17:50:45    25          A.     DPM.                              17:50:46    Page 433 with � Eis is when he was at DEA, correct?    17:51:31 A.     Yes, sir.                         17:51:33    Q.     Okay. And at some point in Ee    17:51:34 2010 time period, Mallinckrodt retained         17:51:36    Mr. Davis, correct?                            17:51:39    A.     Yes.                              17:51:40    Q.     And they retained him             17:51:41    specifically to examine the then existing       17:51:43 suspicious order monitoring program?            17:51:47    A.     Yes.                              17:51:47    Q.     Okay. And so I know he was        17:51:48 retained for a brief period of time, but do     17:51:53 you recall how long his engagement lasted?      17:51:58 A.     A couple of months, at most.       17:52:02 Q.     Okay. Now, this memo, is it       17:52:07 accurate to describe it is his overview of      17:52:08 the suspicious order monitoring program based   17:52:17 on his review? Is that fair to say?            17:52:19    A.     Yes, he was reviewing one          17:52:22    particular procedure.                          17:52:24    Q.     Okay.                             17:52:25    A.     Yes.                              17:52:25    Q.     And the procedure is consistent    17:52:25 with the formal documents we were referring     17:52:28 to earlier that you were in charge of           17:52:29    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 109 (430 - 433)     Case: \A�lfmi0�f&$S&n�>9�fr^^l^E^^oOy^me^kQ^^^^^^^^^ew    Page 434    1    drafting Eat outlined the policies and         17:52:32    2    procedures Mallinckrodt would follow to         17:52:37    3    identify potentially suspicious orders,         17:52:38    4    correct?                                      17:52:40    5                  MR.

And in his review of        17:52:41    9    this particular draft of the suspicious order   17:52:45    10    monitoring program � actually, let's take a    17:52:50    11    step back.                                    17:52:57    12                  During the time Eat you were      17:52:57    13    drafting and revising these policies, you had   17:53:01    14    previously testified that you were still        17:53:04    15    utilizing a suspicious order monitoring         17:53:08    16    program, correct?                              17:53:10    17          A.     Yes.                              17:53:11    18          Q.     And with the suspicious order      17:53:12    19    monitoring program being utilized during a      17:53:16    20    particular time period between 2008 and 2012,   17:53:19    21    would it be reflective of a draft policy that   17:53:23    22    you are writing or would it be reflective of    17:53:27    23    some other policy?                             17:53:32    24                  MR. O'CONNOR: Object to form.     17:53:34    25                  THEWITNESS: We have a            17:53:34    9 10    Page 436 which he says, quote, ""Federal Register         17:54:56    Notices published as early as 2007, 72          17:54:59    Federal Register 36487, state specifically      17:55:02 that using formulas that rely on percentages    17:55:05 or averages over time has been determined, by   17:55:07 the DEA, to be insufficient.""                   17:55:10    Did I read that correctly?         17:55:12    A.     Yes.                              17:55:14    Q.     Okay. And the Federal Register    17:55:18 that he's referring to that's been published    17:55:21    11    as early as 2007,1 believe that's also         17:55:24    12    reference to the SouEwood notice; is that      17:55:26    13    correct?                                      17:55:27    14          A.     I don't know for certain, but      17:55:27    15    if-                                         17:55:29    16          Q.     Okay.                             17:55:30    17          A.     Yes, if you say so, yes.           17:55:31    18          Q.     Setting aside which particular     17:55:32    19    Federal Register that refers to, he reports     17:55:35    20    to you as of November 2, 2010, that it is in    17:55:37    21    fact his belief that a suspicious order         17:55:42    22    monitoring program that uses formulas to rely   17:55:48    23    on percentages or averages over time would be   17:55:49    24    insufficient, correct?                         17:55:52    25                  MR. O'CONNOR: Object to form.     17:55:53    Page 435    1           document management system, and           17:53:37    2           then � so after all the approvals,       17:53:43    3           it's housed there and it's considered     17:53:45    4           a formal policy. However, DEA            17:53:47    5           compliance did not use that system.       17:53:50    6                  So indeed this controlled          17:53:52    7           substance compliance 3.0 was in draft     17:53:55    8           form for a while, and I do not know if    17:53:57    9          it was finalized, but we were             17:54:00    10           operating by it.                          17:54:02    11    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                            17:54:02    12           Q.     Right. Okay. And that's          17:54:03    13    helpful.                                       17:54:05    14                  So as you prepared drafts,         17:54:05    15    whatever operative draft that you were          17:54:07    16    working on at the time was also the policy      17:54:10    17    that you would follow with respect to           17:54:15    18    Mallinckrodt's suspicious order monitoring      17:54:16    19    obligations, correct?                          17:54:18    20           A.     Correct.                           17:54:19    21           Q.     Okay. Now, he - Mr. Davis        17:54:20    22    reports to you, as we had discussed before,     17:54:33    23    his evaluation of Mallinckrodt's suspicious     17:54:39    24    order monitoring program at the time. And in   17:54:44    25    particular, I want to focus on the portion in   17:54:45    Page 437    1                  THEWITNESS: Those are the        17:55:54    2           statements he made, yes.                  17:55:55    3    QUESTIONS BY MR. KO:                            17:56:15    4          Q.     Okay. He goes on to state that    17:56:15    5    ""an order must not be processed and filled if   17:56:17    6    it is either suspicious or excessive.""          17:56:21    7                  Do you see that?                   17:56:22    8          A.     Yes.                              17:56:23    9          Q.     ""The existing SOP excels to        17:56:23    10    meet this requirement through a specific        17:56:25    11    evaluation process; however, the numeric        17:56:28    12    formula is problematic. For example, should    17:56:32    13    an occasion arise where an order is three       17:56:32    14    times over the historical average for that      17:56:35    15    customer in item, or in a situation where the   17:56:36    16    order meets but does not exceed EeQ          17:56:38    17    criteria, it would theoretically be filled      17:56:42    18    through normal processing without further       17:56:44    19    question. In doing so, in certain cases and    17:56:46    20    as noted in recent immediate suspensions of     17:56:50    21    other large-scale DEA registrants, which are    17:56:53    22    all a matter of public record, Mallinckrodt     17:56:56    23    would be unnecessarily exposing itself to       17:56:58    24    potential liability.""                           17:57:00    25                  Did I read that correctly?         17:57:02    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 110 (434 - 437)     Case: \A�lfmi0�f&$S&n�>9�fr^^l^E^^oOy^me^^Q^^^^^^^^^evj    Page 438    1          A.

And the? criteria that    17:57:03    3    he's referring to here is EeQ metric that    17:57:05    4    we had discussed before, correct?               17:57:09    5          A.     Yes.                              17:57:10    6          Q.     Okay. And is it accurate to       17:57:11    7    say that as of November 2, 2010, he is          17:57:14    8    expressing the view that reliance on a          17:57:17    9    numeric formula such as a^] criteria could     17:57:20    10    potentially expose Mallinckrodt to a            17:57:24    11    liability? Correct?                           17:57:27    12          A.     Yes.                              17:57:27    13          Q.

Okay. And again, the subject      18:06:15    16    of this e-mail is the SOM program.              18:06:16    17                  Is it accurate to say that you     18:06:19    18    are at this point asking Jim, or James, for a   18:06:24    19    presentation to a larger group about            18:06:29    20    Mallinckrodt's SOM program?                     18:06:31    21           A.     It appears that way. I            18:06:32    22    don't--1 do not remember these comments at    18:06:34    23    all about the presentation--                   18:06:36    24           Q.     Sure.                             18:06:37    25           A.     � but I've refamiliarized         18:06:37    Page 448    1                  So we approached Jim Parker to     18:07:41    2    ask him if he would lend his operational        18:07:44    3    expertise to the suspicious order monitoring    18:07:47    4    program. And in order to do that, these        18:07:48    5    folks had to be chartered. So part of the      18:07:52    6    charter statement was, what's the potential     18:07:54    7    financial impact if we do not do--perform     18:07:59    8    this project.                                  18:08:02    9                  So that's why I'm referring to     18:08:03    10    this potential lost business and actual fines   18:08:05    11    which may be composed � imposed for            18:08:09    12    regulatory noncompliance.                       18:08:12    13          Q.

All right.                         18:09:44    15           Q.     - of the agreement entitled       18:09:45    16    ""Admission of Responsibility.""                  18:09:47    17           A.     Is that acceptance of              18:09:49    18    responsibility?                                18:09:51    19          Q.     Sorry, acceptance of               18:09:52    20    responsibility. Thank you.                     18:09:53    21           A.     All right.                         18:09:55    22           Q.     Do you see that section?           18:09:55    23           A.     Yes.                              18:09:57    24           Q.     And I know that earlier we had     18:09:57    25    been discussing some specific language, and     18:10:20    Page 452    1    talking about a covered time period,            18:11:42    2    January 1, 2012, until - oh, prior to          18:11:44    3    January 1, 2012, yes.                          18:11:55    4          Q.     Okay. So the covered time         18:11:56    5    period � and I believe there's �              18:12:00    6          A.     I'm sorry.                        18:12:02    7          Q.     No, it's okay. If s not your      18:12:03    8    fault. I should have more -- more copies.      18:12:05    9                  So there is a definition of the    18:12:10    10    covered time period in Eis agreement.          18:12:13    11          A.     All right.                        18:12:15    12          Q.     And you can take a look at the     18:12:16    13    document, but I believe if my memory serves     18:12:19    14    me correct, that the covered time period        18:12:23    15    begins from January 1, 2008, through Ee date   18:12:25    16    of the signing of Eat agreement.               18:12:29    17          A.     So that's part of the              18:12:34    18    background.                                   18:12:35    19          Q.     Right.                            18:12:36    20          A.     Right. It's part of Ee           18:12:39    21    background.                                   18:12:40    22          Q.     And so I just want to make sure    18:12:41    23    the record is clear.                           18:12:42    24                  So for purposes of Ee             18:12:43    25    Section 4 that we were looking at � we were    18:12:45    Page 451    1    certainly didn't expect you to remember         18:10:24    2    specifically what was included. But in that    18:10:25    3    section, there is reference made that during    18:10:29    4    the covered time period certain aspects of      18:10:33    5    Mallinckrodt's systems to monitor and detect    18:10:36    6    suspicious orders did not meet the standards    18:10:39    7    outlined in the DEA letters provided to you     18:10:41    8    in 2006 and 2007. Is that accurate?            18:10:43    9          A.     Yes.                              18:10:47    10           Q.     Okay. And do you - sitting       18:10:52    11    here today, do you agree with that admission?   18:10:55    12           A.     We admitted no wrongdoing, but,    18:10:57    13    yes, I agree with the MOA--the statement in   18:11:02    14    the MOA.                                       18:11:06    15           Q.     Okay. And the covered time        18:11:07    16    period, by the way, just so the record is       18:11:09    17    clear � and you can take a look at the         18:11:10    18    document if you'd like. But the covered time   18:11:12    19    period for the settlement agreement is from     18:11:15    20    January 1, 2008, through January 1, 2012,       18:11:16    21    correct?                                       18:11:19    22           A.     So that's covered conduct, but     18:11:20    23    this paragraph relating to the admission of     18:11:33    24    guilt -- or acceptance of responsibility �     18:11:36    25    very poor choice of words on my part � is      18:11:40    Page 453    1    just looking at the admission of               18:12:46    2    responsibility?                               18:12:48    3          A.     Yes.                              18:12:48    4          Q.     � there is reference made to      18:12:48    5    the covered � from the covered time period     18:12:50    6    to January 1,2012, correct?                   18:12:53    7          A.

I helped Mr. Ratliff obtain the    18:34:49    21    reports he was requesting in terms of the       18:34:56    22    shipments of the particular drug product that   18:35:03    23    was the object of the investigation.             18:35:05    24           Q.     Okay. And is there any other      18:35:07    25    involvement that you had with the situation     18:35:10    Page 465    1          A.     I apologize.                      18:35:56    2                  So we made the decision to go      18:35:56    3    to Sunrise and conduct an audit. Mr. Ratliff   18:35:59    4    contacted Pete Kleissle, who was our            18:36:04    5    diversion group supervisor of DEA St. Louis.    18:36:06    6                  Pete came to Mallinckrodt, and     18:36:10    7    we had an informal conversation about �        18:36:11    8    where Mr. Ratliff conveyed the circumstances    18:36:15    9    around the law enforcement investigation.       18:36:18    10    And Mr. Ratliff told Pete Kleissle that we      18:36:20    11    intended to go and conduct an audit of          18:36:23    12    Sunrise. So I was present for that meeting.    18:36:26    13          Q.     Okay. And so Tennessee was        18:36:29    14    brought up in the context of we received this   18:36:30    15    information from this individual in             18:36:33    16    Morristown?                                   18: 36: 34    17          A.

What I've handed you        18:43:53    3    here is an e-mail Eat you received from        18:43:57    4    Eileen Spaulding dated August 11, 2016; is      18:43:59    5    that correct?                                 18:44:03    6          A.

Okay. And was she working more    18:44:29    19    with suspicious order monitoring or             18:44:32    20    controlled substances compliance in August      18:44:34    21    of 2016?                                      18:44:37    22          A.     Suspicious order monitoring.       18:44:37    23          Q.     Okay.

I      18:47:17    5    cannot tell that by this document.              18:47:21    6          Q.     Okay. And do you know if you      18:47:22    7    normally had your team running them, the        18:47:25    8    Google Alerts for oxycodone and the oEer key   18:47:27    9    words we had talked about, once a day or once   18:47:30    10    a week?                                       18:47:33    11          A.

And then when you said,     18:47:57    24    ""Not all articles require any kind of          18:47:59    25    chargeback lookup whatsoever,"" typically did    18:48:02    Page 475    1    point?                                         18:46:12    2           A.

If we learned Ee name of a        18:52:35    23    physician for Eat period of time we were       18:52:39    24    conducting Eat activity through Google Alert   18:52:41    25    or when we were talking to our wholesaler and   18:52:44    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 121 (478 - 481)     Case: fcl^fyOgg/^B^n^#:l^l^E^^oOy^me^^Q^^^^^^^^^rlew    Page 482    1    distributor customers about their due           18:52:49    2    diligence with Ee downstream registrants,      18:52:53    3    the pharmacies, sometimes they had gathered     18:52:55    4    information on who the top prescribers were     18:52:59    5    at a pharmacy.                                 18:53:02    6          Q.     Okay.                             18:53:03    7          A.     So then we'd compare Eat name     18:53:03    8    to our list of top prescribers.                 18:53:06    9          Q.     Okay. And then if you found       18:53:08    10    that person on the list of top prescribers,     18:53:10    11    what, if anything, would you do?                18:53:13    12          A.

It was a contributing factor to    18:53:16    15    whether we � it was another factor in          18:53:20    16    evaluating whether we would restrict the        18:53:23    17    payment of chargebacks to that pharmacy.        18:53:27    18          Q.     Okay.

Yes.                            18:55:02    24          Q.     Okay. And so would you review     18:55:03    25    Eose Federal Register documents for           18:55:05    1    distributor's pharmacy or from their    Page 483 18:53:48    2    information about a physician, you also had a   18:53:49    3    list from an internal group that was Ee        18:53:52    4    highest prescribers of oxycodone, and you       18:53:55    5    would compare Ee two and use Eose as a        18:53:57    6    factor in making a determination of whether     18:54:01    7    you were giving chargebacks?                  18:54:02    8                 MR.

I just wanted to make       18:54:10    18    sure I understood that.                       18:54:12    19                 But Een Eat practice was         18:54:13    20    discontinued after a relatively short period    18:54:14    21    of time?                                    18:54:17    22          A.     Again, I don't know Ee stop       18:54:17    23    and Ee start date or how long we used Eat     18:54:19    24    as a component of our program. I don't know.   18:54:22    25          Q.     But it was - it was stopped       18:54:24    Page 485    1    physicians that had been indicted or arrested   18:55:10    2    for anything involving prescription opioids?    18:55:13    3          A.     Yes.                              18:55:17    4          Q.     Okay. And what would you do       18:55:18    5    with that information if you saw it?            18:55:20    6          A.     So that would have been during     18:55:21    7    the same amount of time.                       18:55:26    8          Q.     Okay.                             18:55:28    9          A.     If we're reviewing information     18:55:28    10    gathered by any source that named a             18:55:30    11    prescriber, we were � we were comparing that   18:55:31    12    to Ee top prescriber listing of � that had    18:55:34    13    been supplied to us.                           18:55:38    14          Q.     Okay. But once that - that       18:55:39    15    short-term practice ended, did you continue     18:55:41    16    to do Eat?                                   18:55:44    17          A.     No.                               18:55:45    18          Q.     Okay. Okay. And when you         18:55:46    19    would receive these Google Alerts and it        18:56:01    20    would talk about pharmacies, would you look     18:56:02    21    at the area that Ee pharmacy was in?           18:56:06    22          A.     Yes.                              18:56:09    23          Q.     Okay. And what information        18:56:11    24    would you gather about the area Eat the        18:56:12    25    pharmacy was in?                               18:56:14    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 122 (482 - 485)     Case: \A�lfmi0�f&$S&n�>9�fr^^l^E^^oOy^me^^Q^^^^^^^^^evj    Page 486    1          A.     So I'd like to clarify. It was    18:56:14    2    more so the pharmacy name �                   18:56:22    3          Q.     Okay.                             18:56:23    4          A.     � and that would prompt us to     18:56:23    5    look through our chargebacks. And if there     18:56:25    6    was a nexus of the city and states � in the    18:56:30    7    case of Joe's Pharmacy, if Ee Google Alert     18:56:32    8    said the same city and state as was             18:56:34    9    referenced in our chargeback information, we    18:56:37    10    knew that there was a correlation.              18:56:40    11          Q.     Okay. But if it said, for         18:56:41    12    example, Joe's Pharmacy in Rocky Top,           18:56:45    13    Tennessee, did you go and do any research on    18:56:50    14    Rocky Top, Tennessee, other than to verify      18:56:52    15    that Joe's Pharmacy was in Rocky Top,           18:56:55    16    Tennessee?                                    18:56:57    17          A.     At times, yes.                    18:56:58    18          Q.     Okay. And what would prompt       18:56:58    19    you to do Eat?                                18:57:01    20          A.     Some of the media alerts           18:57:01    21    contained things like statements that in a      18:57:04    22    certain region there was an issue, and so       18:57:09    23    then that would prompt us to look at Ee        18:57:13    24    chargebacks by � in a specific geographic      18:57:15    25    area.                                         18:57:18    Page 488    1    back and says, ""Okay, thank you. I didn't do   18:58:04    2    much with them, as Carrie started the project   18:58:06    3    and then Jen took it over and just wanted to    18:58:08    4    double-check.""                                 18:58:11    5                  That seems correct with your       18:58:11    6    memory?                                        18:58:13    7          A.     Yes.                              18:58:13    8          Q.     Okay. And so going back to the    18:58:14    9    section of the e-mail where you're talking      18:58:15    10    about the amount of hits is correct?            18:58:17    11          A.     Yes.                              18:58:21    12          Q.     Yes. Okay.                        18:58:22    13                  So when you respond to her         18:58:23    14    about we're looking at pharmacy name and        18:58:25    15    address, you don't mention physician or         18:58:26    16    location, those things we just talked about.    18:58:30    17                  That's because that short-lived    18:58:32    18    initiative had already been terminated by       18:58:34    19    that point; is that right?                      18:58:37    20                  MR. O'CONNOR: Objection to        18:58:37    21          form.                                    18:58:38    22                  THEWITNESS: So the physician     18:58:38    23          piece was not part of the program         18:58:42    24          then. It was an error of omission in     18:58:45    25          the e-mail. We would indeed do           18:58:48    Page 487    1          Q.     Okay. So let's finish up with     18:57:19    2    your e-mail here before we move on to the       18:57:24    3    next one.                                    18:57:25    4          A.     Okay.                            18:57:25    5          Q.     So it says, ""Google Alerts are     18:57:26    6    scanned quickly for any mention of a pharmacy   18: 57: 27    7    name or address.

Yes.                              19:00:16    9          Q.     Okay. And who did you have        19:00:19    10    that discussion with?                          19:00:20    11          A.     It would have been the team.       19:00:21    12    We have a suspicious order monitoring team      19:00:23    13    meeting approximately once a month.             19:00:26    14          Q.     Okay. And when did you discuss    19:00:29    15    Tennessee?                                    19:00:31    16          A.     I don't have a date.               19:00:31    17          Q.     Okay. Do you know how many        19:00:34    18    times you discussed Tennessee?                 19:00:34    19          A.     I do not.                         19:00:35    20          Q.     Okay. Do you know if you          19:00:37    21    discussed Tennessee recently?                  19:00:38    22          A.     I don't recall discussing it       19:00:40    23    recently.                                     19:00:43    24          Q.     Okay. Do you know what the        19:00:44    25    substance was of the conversations about        19:00:45    Page 492    1    as we would have all Ee notes that were        19:01:50    2    pertinent, and discussed it relative to         19:01:52    3    suspicious order monitoring.                   19:01:55    4          Q.     Okay. Do you recall when that     19:01:56    5    DEA conference was?                            19:01:57    6          A.     I do not.                         19:01:59    7          Q.     Okay. But you think there         19:01:59    8    would have been notes on it?                   19:02:01    9          A.     I do not know.                    19:02:02    10          Q.     Okay. And do you recall what      19:02:05    11    they said about Tennessee at that DEA           19:02:08    12    conference?                                   19:02:11    13          A.     Yes.                              19:02:11    14          Q.     What did they say?                19:02:12    15          A.     The DEA showed an interactive      19:02:13    16    map of the migration of the abuse or misuse     19:02:23    17    of oxycodone pills emanating from Florida and   19:02:28    18    moving throughout different states.             19:02:32    19          Q.     Okay. Do you recall anything      19:02:33    20    else they said about Tennessee?                19:02:41    21          A.     No.                               19:02:42    22          Q.     Okay. And other than what         19:02:43    23    we've discussed, do you recall any other        19:02:45    24    conversations substantively about pill mills    19:02:47    25    E Tennessee?                                 19:02:50    Page 491    1    Tennessee?                                     19:00:47    2           A.     So we looked at chargebacks in     19:00:48    3    a number of ways, Google Alerts                 19:00:56    4    notwithstanding.                               19:00:59    5           Q.     Okay.                             19:01:00    6          A.     And so the chargeback reports      19:01:00    7    were sorted by state, so that would prompt a    19:01:05    8    review of the distributions by our customers    19:01:11    9    to end � end downstream registrants within     19:01:16    10    certain states if the numbers met a certain     19:01:20    11    criteria.                                      19:01:24    12           Q.     Okay. Okay. I'll get back to     19:01:25    13    that in just one second, the state sorting of   19:01:28    14    the chargeback data.                           19:01:31    15           A.     Okay.                             19:01:32    16          Q.     Other than sorting the             19:01:32    17    chargeback data by state, do you recall any     19:01:34    18    other substantive conversations about pill      19:01:36    19    mills in Tennessee?                            19:01:38    20           A.     It was mentioned at DEA            19:01:39    21    conferences. I don't specifically know which   19:01:42    22    one.                                           19:01:44    23           Q.     Okay.                             19:01:44    24           A.     But we would have brought that     19:01:44    25    back to the suspicious order monitoring team,   19:01:46    Page 493    1          A.     No.                               19:02:50    2          Q.     Okay. Okay. And I think I        19:02:51    3    might have asked you this question before, so   19:03:12    4    if I did, just tell me that I did, and I        19:03:16    5    apologize for asking it before.                 19:03:20    6                  Other Ean the discussion we       19:03:20    7    had talked about, the communication with the    19:03:23    8    officer from Morristown and you and             19:03:23    9    Mr. Ratliff, have you ever communicated wiE    19:03:25    10    any other law enforcement from Tennessee?       19:03:27    11          A.     Not to my knowledge.               19:03:28    12          Q.     Okay. And do you know if          19:03:29    13    anyone on your team ever did?                  19:03:31    14          A.     So I'd like to clarify the         19:03:33    15    previous answer.                               19:03:34    16          Q.     Sure.                             19:03:34    17          A.     So law enforcement officers        19:03:35    18    from various jurisdictions were members of      19:03:38    19    this National Association of Drug Diversion     19:03:41    20    Investigators.                                 19:03:44    21          Q.     Okay.                             19:03:44    22          A.     And so they came to conferences    19:03:44    23    with us.                                      19:03:47    24          Q.     Okay.                             19:03:47    25          A.     So I may have had a discussion     19:03:47    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 124 (490 - 493)     Case: \A�lfmi0�f&$S&n�>9�fr^^l^E^^oOy^me^^{^^^^^^^Q^ew    Page 494    1    with them as a member of law enforcement,       19:03:50    2    particularly if we were speaking at the         19:03:52    3    conference and talking about our placebo        19:03:59    4    program for law enforcement.                   19:04:01    5          Q.     Okay. But do you recall any       19:04:02    6    specific conversations with anyone from         19:04:04    7    Tennessee?                                    19:04:05    8          A.     No.                               19:04:05    9          Q.     Okay. And oEer than that         19:04:06    10    conversation with the law enforcement officer   19:04:08    11    from Morristown about a specific                19:04:09    12    investigation, you don't recall any             19:04:12    13    communications about any other specific         19:04:14    14    investigations within Tennessee that you were   19:04:16    15    involved in?                                  19:04:18    16          A.

So I cannot speak - I did         19:04:22    20    not � I wasn't always privy.                   19:04:25    21          Q.     Okay.                             19:04:26    22          A.     If our security director, Bill     19:04:27    23    Ratliff, our current vice president of          19:04:31    24    security, John Gillies, was involved in an      19:04:33    25    investigation, but not to my knowledge.         19:04:36    Page 496    1    Mallinckrodt, wiE any Tennessee pharmacies     19:05:40    2    being reported to the DEA?                    19:05:43    3          A.     Again, if I researched Ee         19:05:44    4    chargeback-restricted pharmacies, perhaps,      19:05:50    5    but I would not have had any other             19:05:53    6    conversation Ean Eat.                       19:05:55    7          Q.     Okay. Do you know how many        19:05:55    8    Tennessee pharmacies have been put on          19:06:05    9    chargeback restriction?                       19:06:06    10          A.

Okay. So for the folks that       19:48:50    15    were the top prescribers of oxy 15 and          19:48:53    16    oxy 30, those could be legitimate doctors.      19:48:56    17    They could be at the top of the list; is that   19:48:58    18    right?                                          19:49:01    19           A.     Correct.                           19:49:01    20           Q.     Or those could be people who       19:49:01    21    were operating pill mills. They could also     19:49:03    22    be at the top of the list?                      19:49:05    23           A.     Potentially, yes.                  19:49:06    24           Q.     Okay.

But I don't want to     19:47:33    5    reach too far into the brands because --        19:47:34    6    okay.                                          19:47:37    7           Q.     Okay.

So that is when, in the            19:47:58    19    circumstance we spoke about before, if we       19:48:01    20    were reviewing a downstream registrant and      19:48:04    21    their due diligence with a particular           19:48:10    22    pharmacy, if the distributor's file contained   19:48:12    23    information about the top prescribers at        19:48:18    24    those pharmacies, we would vet that against     19:48:19    25    Ee list of the top prescribers per IMS.        19:48:22    Page 529    1          A.     When we used that list and the     19:49:12    2    review with our distributors of their           19:49:18    3    downstream registrants, again, if they          19:49:20    4    provided us the names of the top prescribers    19:49:22    5    at the pharmacy, and if that coincided with     19:49:26    6    the top prescriber list we had within the       19:49:29    7    country, we would have a detailed              19:49:32    8    conversation with the distributor about the     19:49:34    9    fact that that prescriber appeared on the       19:49:37    10    list.                                         19:49:40    11          Q.     So that they were a top            19:49:40    12    prescriber?                                   19:49:43    13          A.     Yes.                              19:49:43    14          Q.

We spoke before about the NAMs,    19:49:58    19    the narcotic � national account managers.      19:50:00    20          Q.     Yes, ma'am.                       19:50:02    21          A.     We asked them to be our            19:50:03    22    observers, and if they saw anything at any of   19:50:05    23    our customers that may appear to be a red       19:50:10    24    flag, that they would report to the company.    19:50:11    25          Q.

As you know, they have been growing in sales each and every month and when I was visiting with them this week, they introduced me to their new sales manager. He was Anda's # 1 salesman and brings a wealth of knowledge and systems to Sunrise.    This salesman is extremely tied into the Florida market and has been the cause of most of the growth (new customers, contacts, etc.). In addition to the recently hired sales manager, they are adding 5 additional salespeople, as well as additional states to distribute product to.   To make a long story short, I wanted you to be aware of their growth and to supply you with some new monthly sales projections for this account.    Beginning in January, can we raise our projections for Sunrise to:    CONFIDENTIAL                                                                                                                                                           MAL-MI 000031628    CONFIDENTIAL�SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER                                                                                 MNK-T1  0000290502     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1957-53  Filed:  07/23/19 3 of 3.

Okay.   4   would it not?    5       Q.    So is it fair to say that the opioid   5   MR.

Did you have particular concerns with   16   I'll do my very best, but I haven't really thought    17  opioid products going to Florida and from there making   17   about any of this since I retired.

There came a time that we began to look at   1   states that were having issues, I believe, but it was    2  our customer's customer. We manufactured oxycodone.   2   Florida was where DEA really wanted us to focus our    3  We sold that to distributors and distributors sold   3   efforts at that time.    4  that to their customers. And there came a time when   4   Q.    And in just going back briefly to the    5  we started looking at our customer's customer. So I   5   issue of hot spots, do you � do you recall    6  actually went to Florida and reviewed a number of   6   conversations about Tennessee?    7  pharmacies to see if they were legitimate pharmacies   7   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    8  in my opinion or if they were, I guess what you would   8   BY THE WITNESS:    9  call a pill mill.   9   A.    Not specifically.    io       Q.    And why go to Florida to do that?   10   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    ii       A.    Because that was, I think, according to   11   Q.    What about Ohio?    12  DEA one of the hot spots. There were others in the   12   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    13  United States that we also looked at, but Florida was   13   BY THE WITNESS:    14  one that DEA was particularly concerned about.   14   A.    Not specifically.    15       Q.    And do you recall what some of the other   15   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    16 hot spots were?   16   Q.    Now, with respect to Florida, what were    17       A.    I do. New Jersey would be one, Las Vegas,   17   your concerns about Florida?    18  Nevada would be another, as an example.   18   A.    We were getting information that a number    19       Q.    What about Kentucky?   19   of the pharmacies, these would be the customers of our    20       A.    I'm certain we've discussed Kentucky in   20   customer, were purchasing large amounts of oxycodone    21  those terms.   21   30s, 30-milligram tablets.    22       Q.    And what about West Virginia?   22   Q.    And was the concern that this would �    23       A.    I'm not certain if that was a term we used   23   this would � these products were essentially being    24  or a state we looked at while I was still employed,   24   diverted?

The �   3   Based on your experience and in your    4  the effort was to go and obtain additional information   4   opinion were there a higher number of pill mills in    5   so we can make an assessment of those pharmacies. You   5   Florida than in other states?    6  know, one, for example, may be next to a Veterans   6   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    7  Administration hospital and maybe they had a reason   7   BY THE WITNESS:    8  for purchasing large amounts, others may be putting   8   A.    I don't � I would have no way to assess    9  them back into the illicit market. So we needed   9   that.    10  additional information to make an assessment whether   10   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    11  or not that we would continue to supply our   11   Q.    Would it be fair to say you identified a    12  distributor. The distributor had a responsibility to   12   large number of pill mills in Florida?    13  know their customers. They have the same exact   13   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    14  responsibility that a manufacturer has to develop a   14   BY THE WITNESS:    15  program to prevent diversion. So they are supposed to   15   A.    I would say yes.    16  have security people just like myself that would go to   16   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    17  those pharmacies and review them.   17   Q.    And would you agree that the pills that    18              So to obtain additional information, I   18   ended up with these pill mills in Florida � well,    19  went to Florida and I obtained cooperation from two of   19   strike that.    20  our forensic auditors from Covidien that didn't work   20   The pills that went to these pill mills in    21  for Mallinckrodt to go to the east side of the state,   21   Florida didn't always stay in Florida, did they?    22  they were both fluent in Spanish, to review these   22   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    23  high � they were high dosage pharmacies to see were   23   BY THE WITNESS:    24  they good, solid pharmacies or were they very small   24   A.    I'd have no way to know that.    Page 35      Page 37    1  pharmacies with no other products in their � on their   1   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    2   shelves and signs that indicated Mallinckrodt products   2   Q.    Do you recall ever being informed or    3   sold for cash only. So we went to Florida and we made   3   contacted by law enforcement in other states    4  that review and then we made recommendations, not only   4   indicating that they had � they had possession of    5  to DEA, that we were not going to provide product to   5   Mallinckrodt product from the illicit market and it    6  our distributors to go to those but that they should   6   appears that that product came from Florida?    7  also review our results because we, you know, stopped   7   A.    I believe that we received information    8   selling to our distributor. And the distributor's   8   from Tennessee. They requested assistance on    9  responsibility then was to � to go to that pharmacy   9   identifying the actual numbers the � that are    10  and make an assessment also. And if they had   10   contained on the bottles and that we provided that    11  information that we didn't have, they could always   11   information, and that's � it's been a long time ago,    12  come forward.   12   and I believe that was the case.    13       Q.    And you indicated that you went to Florida   13   Q.    So that would be an example of pills    14  to make an assessment of these pharmacies and   14   traveling from Florida to Tennessee in the illicit    15  essentially determine if they were pill mills or not,   15   market, is that fair?    16  is that fair?   16   A.    Fair.    17       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   17   Q.    And there is nothing to prevent a pill    18  BY THE WITNESS:   18   that originally is shipped to Florida from being    19       A.    That's fair.   19   transported to Kentucky, is there?    20  BY MR. KAWAMOTO:   20   A.    No.    21       Q.    And what were the results of that   21   Q.

DEA - I spoke with DEA frequently, Pete   2   And I remember basically what the e-mail    3  Kleisele, and that information would have been gleaned   3   says, because they came to Mallinckrodt, to my office,    4  from conversations with Pete.   4   on occasion asking for assistance in how to    5  BY MR.

And so DEA indicated to you that they were   6   whatever we could in assistance, so.    7  concerned that people were coming from out of state   7   Q.    And H.D. Smith was a Mallinckrodt    8  into Florida to obtain opioid products?   8   customer?    9       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   9   A.    Yes.    io  BY THE WITNESS:   10   Q.    Now, do you see on the e-mail where it    11        A.    That's correct. And we also provided�   11   says:  ""H.D.

Correct.    14  they could have an undercover operation in Florida.   14   Q.    Do you have an understanding of why they    15   So we did know about that, and they couldn't   15   did that?    16  redistribute product that they took in without the   16   A.    The owner � I mean, this is from a � you    17  Attorney General personally approving that. So we   17   have to remember how many years ago this has been.    18  provided placebos to them to assist them with their   18   I'm going to give you my best recollection of that    19  investigation.   19   conversation.    20  BY MR.

Do you know if they stayed in   22   Florida. You guys go down there and see what's going    23  Florida or if they were distributed up and down the   23   on.

And do you see further on in the    7  assistance.   7   e-mail, it says:  ""He went on to explain, as he told    8       MR.

I �   23   monitoring program specifically and to delve into    24 BY MR. KAWAMOTO:   24   their customer's customer. That was � came out of a    Page 43      Page 45    1        Q.    Well, let me rephrase the question.   1   conference that DEA held, if I were guessing, I would    2              Did you � while employed at Mallinckrodt,   2   say '09. It may have been a different time. I just    3  did you share a concern regarding pain management   3   don't want to misspeak. That's �    4  clinics and the prescription of oxy 30s?   4   Q.    No, I understand that, sir.    5       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   5   A.    I'm trying to give you the best, and it's    6  BY THE WITNESS:   6   been a long time.    7        A.    At a point when we started to review our   7   Q.    Now, the � your customers, the    8  customers' customers.   8   distributors, were also supposed to be vetting their    9  BY MR. KAWAMOTO:   9   customers, is that fair?    10        Q.    And at the very bottom of the e-mail, do   10   A.    That's fair.    11  you see the sentence that says:  ""He concluded that if   11   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    12  the pharmacies were filling too many scripts for pain   12   BY MR.

Yes.   15   their customers?    16       Q.    Did you agree with that conclusion?   16   MS. KVESELIS: Object to form.    17        A.    That was their conclusion. I was   17   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    IS-  reporting what they were telling me.   18   Q.    You can answer.    19       Q.    But do you think that conclusion was a   19   A.    Yes.    20  reasonable one for them to be making?   20   Q.    That � the objection is preserved for the    21        A.    As I previously stated, at the time I   21   record.    22  hadn't had an opportunity to review our customers'   22   A.    Um-hum, yes.    23  customers and then the downstream with the pharmacies   23   Q.    And can you describe those concerns?    24  and their patients. So to say � I don't see anywhere   24   MS.

And what distributor was this that we are    2       A.    We weren't sure that they were going to   2   talking about?    3  their customers and doing an audit, so we came up with   3   A.    AmerisourceBergen.    4  a form that required a lot of information from those   4   Q.    Do you recall a distributor named    5  pharmacies that purchased large amounts of our   5   ""Sunrise""?    6 products, and there were a number of questions on   6   A.    Yes.    7  there that would help us, it would give us more   7   Q.    And what do you recall about that    8  information, additional information, and would � it   8   distributor?    9  would allow us to make an assessment then, too, of the   9   A.    That they had hired a DEA either agent or    i o  distributor if they were following up with those   10   compliance analyst to assist them with their � their    ii  pharmacies if there were any concerns.   11   entry into the market. And at some point our people,    12  BY MR. KAWAMOTO:   12   not myself, went to Sunrise to review the operation    13       Q.    And do you recall any of the distribute �   13   and make a determination if they were a legitimate    14  strike that.   14   enterprise.    15             Do you recall any of the distributors that   15   Q.    And do you recall that Sunrise voluntarily    16  you had concerns about?   16   surrendered its license to the DEA?    17       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   17   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    18       MS. KVESELIS: Object to form.   18   BY THE WITNESS:    19  BY THE WITNESS:   19   A.    I don't recall that specifically, but I    20       A.    Our job was to ensure our customers were   20   believe that's correct.    21  in compliance. So if we had concerns about one of   21   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    22  their customers or more than one of their customers,   22   Q.    Do you recall anything about Masters    23  we would bring that to their attention. And it was   23   Pharmaceuticals?    24  the intent that they understood exactly what we   24   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    Page 47      Page 49    1  expected as a manufacturer.   1   BY THE WITNESS:    2  BY MR. KAWAMOTO:   2   A.    I know that I was involved in an audit of    3       Q.    And do you recall any specific   3   Masters.    4  distributors, though, that you had concerns about   4   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    5  their compliance?   5   Q.    And what do you recall about that audit?    6       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   6   A.    Almost nothing. It's been so long ago,    7  BY MR. KAWAMOTO:   7   and what happens is that the different audits, they    8       Q.    Do any � do any names stand out for you?   8   just kind of all meld together, and at my age I'm �    9       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   9   I'm having more difficulty remembering things that are    io  BY THE WITNESS:   10   ten years old or � or longer, so.    11       A.    There was one that was dilatory. We gave   11   Q.    Do you know if Masters had its license    12  them specific deadlines, like 30 days, provide this   12   revoked by the DEA?    13  information back to Mallinckrodt so we could make an   13   A.    I believe that to be the case. I know we    14  assessment in 30 days. They didn't always make those   14   made � we sent information to DEA after the audit. I    15  deadlines. That doesn't necessarily mean that they   15   do remember that. But we had two audits within a day    16  were out of compliance or had ill intent. It meant   16   or so of each � of those audits, and that's why I'm    17  that they didn't provide the information. So we would   17   somewhat confused if it's Masters or one of the other    18  have to go back to them and say, We need this   18   distributors.    19  information to make an assessment.   19   Q.    And do you recall what information you    20       Q.    And would-   20   sent to DEA about Masters Pharmaceuticals?    21       A.    On one occasion we brought that to   21   A.    No.    22  management's � the management of that distributor's   22   Q.    What about Harvard, do you recall them as    23  attention. And they, to the best of my knowledge, you   23   a distributor?    24  know, fixed the � the matter right away.   24   A.    I never have been to Harvard. I've heard    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 13 (46 - 49)     Case: ^^-Qmt^m^t^i.#^W^<^e^o Wi&&�^te9di&@�\9.$t��9&.ev,    Page 50      Page 52    1 that name, but that's all I know.   l   off from � from Tyco International.    2       Q.    And what about KeySource?   2   Q.    And with respect to opioid products, what    3       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   3   were your responsibilities, for the opioid products?    4 BY THE WITNESS:   4   A.    To prevent diversion, to ensure that in    5       A.    I think KeySource, again, I'm almost   5   the manufacturing sites that there were programs in    6 guessing, but I believe it's in Cincinnati and was one   6   place.    7 of the ones that we audited during that two-day   7   Q.    And could you define diversion for me?    8 period.   8   What's your understanding of that term?    9 BY MR. KAWAMOTO:   9   A.    Diversion is taking a licit product, a    10       Q.    And do you recall if they lost their   10   legitimate product and taking it away in an illi�    11 license to the DEA for Schedule II narcotics?   11   in an illicit way for one's own personal use or for    12       A.    Again, I'd be guessing. I don't know, but   12   sale.    13 I believe they may have. This has been, you know,   13   Q.    So would the overprescription by a doctor    14 long ago.   14   constitute diversion in your opinion?    15       Q.    Now, you indicated that you were the   15   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    18 secure � that you were the security director for   16   BY THE WITNESS:    17 Mallinckrodt, is that - is that right?   17   A.    There is no way for me to � to without    18       A.    I was the security manager for   18   additional information about a specific doctor to make    i9 Mallinckrodt. I was the security director when it   19   that generalization.    20 became Tyco Healthcare.   20   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    21       Q.    And so were you promoted into that   21   Q.    But if a doctor is prescribing opioids for    22 position?   22   non-medically valid reasons, that would be an example    23       A.    I was.   23   of diversion?    24       Q.    And roughly when did you become the   24   A.    That's a hypothetical, it seems. I don't    Page 51      Page 53    1  security director for Tyco? And I understand that   1   know how I could answer that without specifics.    2  that � this happened a while ago, so, you know, I'm   2   Q.    Well, what specifics would you need?    3  not �   3   A.    I � I'd need to know what type of    4       A.    I'm trying to remember.   4   patients he sees and does he write the same script 90    5       Q.    � I understand that �   5   tablets of 30-milligram for every patient he sees.    6       A.    It is difficult to...   6   Now, would that be a � something that I would want to    7       Q.    � yeah, you may not be exact.   7   know, yes. So if that's the case, but still without    8       A.    I would say sometime in 2001. Is that�   8   additional information, it's really difficult for me    9  and I may be wrong. I may be off a year. I think   9   to make that assessment.    io it's -   10   Q.    But in the example you gave, the 90    ii       Q.    Sure. But the early 2000s, is that right?   11   tablets of 30 of oxy 30 for every patient he sees, in    12       A.    Yes, that would be fair.   12   your � in your view that would be an example of    13       Q.    What were your responsibilities as   13   diversion?    14  security director for Mallinckrodt? I'm sorry.   14   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    15             What were your responsibilities as   15   BY THE WITNESS:    16  security director for Tyco?   16   A.    No. It would be suspicious, but I can't    17       A.    We had facilities all over. We were   17   make the assessment literally without having specifics    i8  responsible for the pharmaceutical section, for   18   about his customers. Would it be suspicious, yes.    19  surgical instmments, for surgical materials. That's   19   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    20  not a good way to say that. If s surgical supplies.   20   Q.    So it could be diversion?    21  And there was additionally one other division that had   21   A.    It's possible.    22  to do with breathing apparatus for people that needed   22   Q.    And the pill mills, the distribution of    23  oxygen. That was sold off fairly early. So we � we   23   Mallinckrodt products by pill mills, that would be    24  maintained those three divisions until Covidien spun   24   another example of diversion, would it not?    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 14 (50 - 53)     Case: ^^-Qmt^m^t^i.#^W^<^e^o P^iM^^^r^SdJ^m^t^^Wiew    Page 54   Page 56    1       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   1             Let me just say one other thing. We asked    2  BY THE WITNESS:   2  DEA for assistance time and time again. They were �    3        A.    It would.   3  they were silent. They gave us � they said it's your    4  BY MR. KAWAMOTO:   4  responsibility. Yeah, but could you just give us a    5        Q.    And so when you say your re � one of your   5  hint about what you would like to see. And they just    6  responsibilities was to prevent diversion, it was to   6  couldn't seem to come up with anything. They said    7  prevent the pill mills from getting your product?   7  it's not their responsibility. To me it is their    8       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   8  responsibility. They are the regulatory agency and    9  BY MR. KAWAMOTO:   9  they are trying to say, no, this is all our    10        Q.    Fair?   io  customers � all of the registrants' issues, and they    11        A.    No, not fair.   11  should have been at least somewhat helpful and they    12              We are the manufacturer. The distributor   12  weren't.    13  has a responsibility to know who their customers are   13       Q.    But at some point in time they did    14  and where those pills are going. So do � do we have   14  indicate to you that you should know your customers's    15  a responsibility to monitor our distributors, yes.   15  customer, right?    16  And we were auditing those distributors just as you've   16       A.    Exactly, yes, they did.    17  discussed with Masters and the other one that you   17       Q.    And at that point would you agree that you    18   said. So we were monitoring those people to make a   18  had an obligation to know your customer's customer?    19  determination if they were doing due diligence on   19       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    2 0  their employees, but you can't take that information   20  BY THE WITNESS:    21  and bring it all of the way back to the manufacturer.   21       A.    At that time we started identifying our    22  You have to go back through DEA in the quota that they   22  customers' customers.    23  allot to each of the manufacturers. We were not by   23  BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    24  any stretch the only manufacturer of oxy. There is   24       Q.    Because DEA indicated that you had that    Page 55   Page 57    1  OxyContin, oxycodone, other products manufactured. So   1  responsibility, yes?    2  you're trying to make a leap that's not necessarily in   2       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    3  my opinion appropriate.   3  BY THE WITNESS:    4       Q.    But you had a responsibility to know your   4       A.    They didn't ever say, You have that    5  customers' customers, did you not?   5  responsibility. It came from a conference in DC    6       MR. O'COISTNOR: Objection.   6  with � with the compliance group and that term at    7  BY THE WITNESS:   7  some point came up. And so it drifted back through    8       A.    At a certain point in time we were told we   8  the grapevine, for lack of a better way to say it,    9  should know our customer's customer, and that came   9  that they were talking about having their � their    10   secondhand out of a meeting in DEA. At that time we   io  registrants know their customer's customer.    11  didn't know how we would even make that determination,   11             And basically at that time we had never    12  how we would even determine who our customers'   12  heard that term. DEA had never come to us personally    13  customers were. And at � at some point we made   13  and said, You need to know your customer's customer.    14  the � we developed information that we had a system   14  So � and by the time DEA actually told us that, it    15  called chargebacks, and if you want me to explain   15  was late in � in 2011. It was the same date they had    16  that, I can't, but I know that we had a system so we   16  the � the earthquake in Washington, D.C. And we felt    17  had information on our distributors' customers.   17  it. Because they said, You need to know your    18              Once we had that information, that's when   18  customer's customer.    19  we started with the forms, sending those out to the   19             And the very next week I was on a plane to    2 0  distributors trying to determine if they had done due   20  Florida because they said, You need to do this. That    21  diligence with all of their customers. They weren't   21  was really the first time they ever told us that we    22  our customers. They were our customers'customers.   22  needed to do that. We had a good program, we did the    23   So we didn't have that responsibility from ad   23  very best we could to prevent diversion, and once they    24  infinitum. It was at a certain point.   24  said, You need to do this, we did it. We did it    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 15 (54 - 57)     Case: ^^-Qmt^m^t^i.#^W^<^e^o W{&&�7&te9dilm\9.$t��9&.ev,    Page 58 i immediately.    2                And for � furthermore, not only did we do    3   that, we started cancelling a lot of these. We were    4   going back to our distributors and telling them, We    5   are not going to � to sell products to you that you    6   sell to these particular pharmacies. And so it    7   worked.    8   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    9         Q.    So you indicated that, I think you just    i�  said: ""We were going back to our distributors and ii telling them that we are not going to sell products to    12   you that sell"" � ""that you sell to these particular    13   pharmacies""?    14         MR. O'CONNOR: Objection. is BY THE WITNESS:    16         A.    That's correct.    17   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    18         Q.    So shouldn't the distributors have done i9 that on their own?    20         MS. KVESELIS: Object to the form.    21         MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    22   BY THE WITNESS:    23         A.    Yeah, yes.    24   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    Page 60    1   of those pharmacies because we felt very strongly that    2   they were selling products they shouldn't of.    3        Q.    And do you recall what � what the case    4   was that you testified on behalf of the DEA in?    5        A.    Gulf Coast Pharmacy, I believe. That's    6   been a long time also.    7        Q.    And you say you visited a total of 30    8   pharmacies, is that right?    9        MR. O'CONNOR: Objection. 10  BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    To the best of your recollection?    Not by -    But you and � you and �    There were two.    � two other forensic officers from �    From Covidien, not from Mallinckrodt, but    17   from the corporation.    18        Q.    Okay.    19        A.    They did the � the others, and I can't    20   recall exactly what the � the separation was, but we    21   covered all of those 30 pharmacies.    22        Q.    And with respect to those 30 pharmacies,    23   do you have a rough estimate from how many you decided    24   should not be receiving Mallinckrodt products?    11   Q-    12   A.    13   Q-    14   A.    15   Q-    16   A.    Page 59    1         Q.    And do you recall how many distributors    2   you went to to tell them: We are no longer going to    3   essentially � well, strike that.    4               Do you recall how many distributors you    5   went to and told them, You need to cut off these    6   customers?    7         A.    We took -    8         MS. KVESELIS: Object to form.    9   BY THE WITNESS:    io       A.    We took the top three, McKesson, Cardinal,    11   and AmerisourceBergen, and we looked at their top ten    12   pharmacies in Florida. So that was � there was �    13   were a total of 30 pharmacies. They were the ones    14   that purchased the most of the oxycodone 30s through    15   their distributors. And so when we identified    16   those � and as I said, when DEA told us that, the    17   very next � next week I was in Florida. And I had�    18   I caused two of our forensic auditors to cover the    19   east side of the state, because they had Spanish    2 o   speaking ability, and I covered the west side of the    21   state. And I went into a number of these pharmacies    22   to try to determine exactly what DEA had said, know    23   your customer's customer. In fact, I had testified in    24   the Fort Myers, Florida on behalf of DEA against one    Page 61 i       A.    I don't know. Some of them were    2   absolutely legitimate pharmacies. You walk in and    3   they look like a Walgreens. And they have all of the    4   products out there. You talk to the pharmacist and    5   she is very aware of issues in Florida and, you know,    6   they would tell me what they were doing to prevent.    7   They looked at the � the scripts written by the    8   doctors to make sure that they were consistent, and    9   sometimes they would contact the doctors. Others were i o   literally pill mills where they � they had to buzz    11   you in at the door and they had stanchions and they    12   had a sign ""Mallinckrodt Cash Only."" To me that's a    13   pill mill.    14         Q.    Is it fair to say it's not that difficult    15   to identify a pill mill if someone has your    16   experience?    17        MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    18   BY THE WITNESS:    19        A.    I don't think that's fair. There are so    20   many variables. You � you know, for me, you know, I    21   spent years in law enforcement. I can look at a    22   situation much differently than one that's never been    23   in law enforcement. I mean, I look at the people that    24   are in and around the pharmacy and if they look like    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 16 (58 - 61)     Case: ^^-Qmt^m^t^i.#^W^<^e^o Wi&&�^te9di&@�\9.$t��9Piev,    Page 62      Page 64    1  they are legitimate pain patients, are � you know,   l   the parking lot, and do they see me and recognize a    2  are there some elderly people on walkers, are there �   2   law enforcement person or a former law enforcement    3  you just need information to be able to make that   3   person who is watching them. So if they got up and    4  assessment. You can't make a blanket assessment,   4   ran, that's a sign.    5  especially without a, in my opinion, a law enforcement   5   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    6 background.   6   Q.    Do you look for out of plate license �    7  BY MR. KAWAMOTO:   7   I'm sorry.    8       Q.    And so when you visit a pharmacy to   8   Do you look for out-of-state license    9  evaluate whether it's a pill mill or not, can you list   9   plates?    io  for me the things that you look for?   10   A.    Yes.    11       A.    One of the things you look for, like I   11   Q.    Why?    12  stated before, is do you have to be buzzed into the   12   A.    Well, I'll give you a specific. In    13  pharmacy. So they look at you and they have to push a   13   Las Vegas there were out-of-state license plates all    14  buzzer to let you in. Very little product on the   14   over, a very large pharmacy, people in the � in the    15  shelf. A sign such as ""Mallinckrodt products left   15   room, there were slot machines, they were dozing off,    16  side, cash only, no insurance.""   16   appeared to � again, with my law enforcement    17       Q.    And these would � these would all be   17   experience, they appeared to be on some kind of    18  indicators that it's a pill mill?   18   narcotic. And when they are selling large amounts    19       A.    Absolutely.   19   of � of that product to people from out of state, you    20       Q.    And what else?   20   know, that's a sign.    21       A.    No product on the shelf, just strictly   21   MR. O'CONNOR: Counsel, we have been going about    22  filling prescriptions in large numbers of � of oxy 30   22   an hour. Should we take a break?    23  going into that and being prescribed. So that's   23   MR. KAWAMOTO: Sure. Why don't - why don't we    24  certainly information that you � you would want   24   take a break then.    Page 63      Page 65    i  more � to make a proper assessment you need as much   1   THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record    2  information as possible. But those are things that I   2   at 10:41.    3  would look for when trying to make an assessment.   3   (WHEREUPON, a recess was had    4       Q.    Do you also look at the clientele of the   4   from 10:41 to 10:53 a.m.)    5  pill mill?   5   THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record at    6       A.    No.   6   10:53.    7       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   7   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    8  BY THE WITNESS:   8   Q.    So, Mr. Ratliff, as you've noted on    9       A.    There is no way to do that.   9   several occasions, I am asking you questions about    io  BY MR. KAWAMOTO:   10   events that have occurred, you know, some years in the    ii       Q.    But you can see who is going in and out of   11   past, and I understand that. So I think what it makes    12  the pharmacy?   12   sense to do is I'm going to start showing you    13       A.    I can, yeah, physically see who is coming   13   documents that I think will help refresh your memory.    14  and going depending on the length of time. That would   14   You should review as much of the document    15  be, as I said before, do they have elderly people, do   15   as you need to be comfortable, but as some of these    16  they have walkers, are they all young people.   16   are, you know, several pages, I will probably � well,    17       Q.    And if they are all young people, is that   17   I will direct you to certain portions that I am    18  a warning sign?   18   interested in. And, you know, as I said, you    19       A.    Well-   19   should � you should review as much of the document as    20       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   20   you feel is appropriate.    21  BY THE WITNESS:   21   So why don't we start with what I believe    22       A.    � there are additional warning signs.

KAWAMOTO:    6       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   6   Q.    So an abnormal order � I guess what I'm    7  BY THE WITNESS:   7   trying to understand is was there a difference with    8       A.    That entailed Karen at least advising me   8   respect to Mallinckrodt's terminology between an    9  about it, and she normally handled all of those   9   abnormal order and a suspicious order?    io  matters.

That's correct.    21  virtue of the fact that it was a registrant under the   21   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    22  Controlled Substances Act, is that correct?   22   Q.    And then if you flip the page to Page 5.    23       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   23   A.    Okay.    24  BY THE WITNESS:   24   Q.    The first bullet point is: ""Failure to    Page 95      Page 97    1        A.    Correct.   1   maintain effective div"" � ""effective controls against    2  BY MR. KAWAMOTO:   2   diversion is inconsistent with the public interest.""    3        Q.    Now, the bottom bullet point is: ""There   3   In other � in other words, this is simply    4  are currently 1,288,992 DEA registrants, DEA must rely   4   that Mallinckrodt has a duty to maintain effective    5  on the States and individual registrants to monitor.""   5   controls against diversion, is that another way of    6              Would you agree with that statement?   6   saying this?    7        A.    It was my understanding that they had more   7   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    8  responsibility than just telling the registrants it's   8   BY THE WITNESS:    9  their responsibility, especially in '08, so. I don't   9   A.    Yes.    10  know who wrote this and I'm not � I just don't know   10   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    11  who wrote it, so. Am I absolutely clear and believe   11   Q.    Now, there is a letter that seems to be    12  that, not necessarily.   12   placed on the side.    13        Q.    Well, if there are over a million DEA   13   Do you see that? Or it is a picture of a    14  registrants, don't they � doesn't DEA have to rely on   14   letter. Do you see that?    15  these registrants to do their monitoring?   15   A.    I see there is a letter there.    16       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   16   Q.    Okay. And if you can make out the date,    17  BY MR. KAWAMOTO:   17   it's December 27, 2007?    18        Q.    How else would the system work if that --   18   A.    Yeah, I can't see that good.    19  if that wasn't the case?   19   Q.    Okay. Is this the 2007 Rannazzisi letter?    20       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   20   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    21  BY THE WITNESS:   21   BY THE WITNESS:    22        A.    We all have a program in place to do that.   22   A.    I have my bifocals and I have my reading    23   So the answer is do they rely on us, yes. Some of   23   glasses and I just can't see well enough to verify    24  these registrants are little tiny things that have   24   what you were saying.

Fair enough.   2   Q.    Well, underneath the heading it says:    3             Do you recall Mr. Rannazzisi sending out a   3   ""DEA suspends licenses of distributors for not    4 letter to registrants in 2007?   4   maintaining effective controls against diversion of    5       A.    I don't recall it specifically, no.   5   controlled substances.""    6       Q.    Okay. What about sending out a letter in   6   Do you see that?    7 2006?   7   A.    I see that.    8       A.    It's just too long ago.   8   Q.    And do you recall what the DEA's concerns    9       Q.    Okay. So Page 6 is:  ""Recent DEA Actions   9   were with respect to the failure to maintain effective    i� Involving Distributors.""   10   controls for these institutions?    ii             Do you see that?   11   A.    No.    12       A.    Yes.   12   Q.    So, can you turn to Page 8 of this    13       Q.    Did Mallinckrodt follow these DEA actions   13   PowerPoint?    14 involving their distributors?   14   A.    I can.    is       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   15   Q.    And it says: ""Revise Controlled Substance    16 BY THE WITNESS:   16   Suspicious Order Monitoring Procedure Highlights.""    17       A.    Yes.   17   Do you see that?    is BY MR. KAWAMOTO:   18   A.    Okay.    19       Q.    Why?   19   Q.    Can you review that list for me and let me    20       A.    DEA, if they suspended a license, then   20   know when you are done?    21 they wouldn't be licensed to have our product.   21   A.    Okay.    22       Q.    Was Mallinckrodt concerned internally   22   Q.    Is this an accurate description of your    23  about the DEA actions involving distributors?   23   suspicious order monitoring procedure?    24       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   24   A.    Yes.    Page 99      Page 101    1  BY THE WITNESS:   1   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    2       A.    Our customers are the distributors. They   2   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    3  send it to their distribution centers. So be clear   3   Q.    And when was this procedure in effect    4  about what you are talking about. A distribution   4   from?    5  center is not � I mean, it's our customer's   5   A.    Say again.    6  distribution center. So did AmerisourceBergen � we   6   Q.    When was this procedure in effect from,    7  did audits of � of some of these, I can recall.   7   what time period did it cover, roughly?    8  BY MR. KAWAMOTO:   8   A.    Based on the PowerPoint, it would be    9       Q.    Well, did the DEA actions involving the   9   June 5th of 2008.    10  distributors raise any concerns at Mallinckrodt   10   Q.    And do you know how far back it went?    11  regarding either your SOM � well, regarding your SOM   11   A.    I don't know.    12  program?   12   Q.    Do you recall it changing at some point in    13       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   13   the future?    14  BY THE WITNESS:   14   A.    I don't recall.    15       A.    No. And the reason is these distributors   15   Q.    Now, it says: ""Security and DEA    16 had multiple distribution centers. If they closed   16   Compliance will work closely with the Business in    17  one, that � they didn't close all of the distribution   17   reviewing peculiar orders and escalation to suspicious    i8  centers.

Yes.    21  be a number of things. I don't know. But I think   21   Q.    And security would be you, is that right?    22  what you are talking about are distribution centers   22   A.    Correct.    23  that they utilized to store their product when it went   23   Q.    What does it mean for security and DEA    24  out to their customers in those areas.   24   compliance to work closely with the business? Who is    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 26 (98 - 101)     Case: ^^-Qmt^h^t^m.#^W^<^e^'o ^{&&2Q&A�9di&@�\9.$t�%l&.ev,    Page 102      Page 104    1  the business?   l   peculiar orders?    2        A.    DEA compliance managed this. If there was   2   A.    There were times that Karen Harper would    3  an issue, she would bring it to my attention, if she   3   bring something in that she couldn't resolve, and I    4  needed additional assistance or guidance. Who she   4   know that I would help her at that time, but I can't    5  dealt with at this time, I can't remember ten years   5   be more specific than that. I just � I just know    6  ago. I just � I can't remember.   6   that we worked together on things like this.    7        Q.    Okay. Though it says security and DEA   7   Q.    Do you recall any instances in which �    8  Compliance, so both of you will work closely with the   8   when Harper shared concerns from business managers    9  business, and so I'm asking from your standpoint as   9   with you regarding suspicious orders?    10  the security person �   10   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    11        A.    Yes.   11   BY THE WITNESS:    12        Q.    � you know, what � what -- how did you   12   A.    I don't recall.    13  work with the business in reviewing peculiar orders   13   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    14  and the escalation of suspicious orders?   14   Q.    So turning to Page 9.    15        A.    Now, all of this listed above that would   15   A.    Okay.    16  come to Karen Harper, and if she had an issue with it   16   Q.    It is a ""Revised Controlled Substance    17  and couldn't resolve it, she would bring it to me.   17   Suspicious Order Customer Checklist.""    18              Does that help.   18   A.    Um-hum.    19       Q.    Okay. But my question relates to the   19   Q.    Do you have any recollection of a customer    20  bottom of the page. And I'm asking, you know, what is   20   checklist?    21  your understanding of how you were going to work with   21   A.    I do.    22  the business in reviewing peculiar orders and the   22   Q.    And what was � what was � who designed    23  escalation to suspicious order status?   23   that checklist?    24       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   24   A.    Karen.    Page 103      Page 105    1  BY THE WITNESS:   1   Q.    Did you have any input into it?    2       A.    I simply can't recall.   2   A.    Karen is pretty � pretty capable of doing    3  BY MR. KAWAMOTO:   3   things like this. Did I approve it or did I look at    4       Q.    Okay. Now, the second part of that   4   it, I'm certain that I probably looked at it at some    5  phrase, ""reviewing peculiar orders and escalation to   5   point, but did I make additions or deletions, it's    6  suspicious order status,"" what � what does � what do   6   way � way too long ago. I don't recall.    7  you interpret that to mean?   7   Q.    Okay. And underneath it says: ""To be    8       A.    It has been ten years. I don't recall. I   8   completed by Field Sales.""    9 just don't remember.   9   A.    Um-hum.    io       Q.    So one of the items above, it says: ""An   10   Q.    And it says: ""Know your customer is the    11  algorithm is customized by customer category, class of   11   goal.""    12  trade.""   12   Is that accurate?    13             Do you see that?   13   A.    I would say yes.    14       A.    I see it.   14   Q.    So as of the tate � date of this    15       Q.    And do you have any recollection of a�   15   PowerPoint, which is June 5th, 2008, your    16  of an algorithm being used?   16   understanding is that there was an obligation for    17       A.    We used algorithms at one point to � if   17   Mallinckrodt to know its customer, is that � is that    18  anyone was � had ordered more of a particular product   18   accurate?    19  and we sent that to DEA. So, I remember that.   19   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    20       Q.    But you don't recall anything about the   20   BY THE WITNESS:    21  algorithm, what it's components were or anything like   21   A.    What we did is we developed a form to give    22  that?   22   us additional information to do that, and that's what    23       A.    Ten years, I don't recall.   23   that form did, it required all kinds of things to be    24       Q.    Do you recall being asked to review   24   filled out to give us additional information, and that    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 27 (102 - 105)     : ^^-Qmt^h^t^m.#^W^<^e^'o P^fM^^^r^SdJ^m^t^^^Le    Page 106    i   was, I think assisted us to know who our customers'    2   customers were.    3   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    4         Q.    And part of this form is a description of    5   the neighborhood, requires an on-site visit, physical    6   description of a facility or photos, and it includes a    7   list of indicators.    8               So, are those statements accurate with    9   respect to what the information that was being io   collected by this customer checklist?    ii       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    12   BY THE WITNESS:    13         A.    To the best of my memory, yeah.    14   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    15         Q.    And to be clear, this was an obligation    16   that Mallinckrodt believed it had based on the    17   applicable law, correct, this wasn't a voluntary i8   endeavor?    19        MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    20   BY THE WITNESS:    21         A.    You are wrong. It was a voluntary    22   endeavor to know more about those customers, to create    23   a better program to comply with the law. So we did    24   this � DEA didn't say, make a form and do this. We    Page 107    1   did this on our own based on what Karen believed would    2   be helpful, so.    3   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    4        Q.    And what she believed was necessary to    5   comply with your requirement or your obligation to    6   maintain effective controls against diversion,    7   correct?    8        A.    We were constantly trying to improve.    9        Q.    And in 2008, one of the ways you    10   believed--well, strike that.    11               In 2008, one of the � one of the factors    12   that you believed would help you improve would be    13   knowing your customer's customer, is that right?    14        A.    Yes.    15        MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    16        THE WITNESS: Sorry.    17   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    18        Q.    And why is it important to know the    19   description of the neighborhood? I'm still on -- on    20   Slide 9 on Page 9.    21        A.    It is an additional factor.    22        Q.    But of what significance, why � why does    23   it help you in your analysis?    24        A.    It is just an -- it is just an additional    Page 108    1   factor. We had everything up and you'd like to know    2   where it is. Is it a � is it a legitimate building,    3   is it in a hospital complex or in a � it depends on    4   where it is. If it's something that doesn't appear to    5   be a legitimate business, that would be of concern to    6   us. If it's down an alley in the back of a store,    7   that would be a concern for us.    8         Q.    And the line that says: ""Requires on-site    9   visit, inside and out,"" what is that in reference to? io       A.    It is to the salespeople signing them up. ii       Q.    So prior to signing up a � prior to    12   signing up a customer, the salesperson was required to    13   conduct an on-site visit?    14         MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    15   BY THE WITNESS:    16         A.    Say that again.    17   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    18         Q.    Prior to signing someone up, the    19   salesperson was required to conduct an on-site visit?    20         MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    21   BY THE WITNESS:    22         A.    Apparently.    23   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    24         Q.    And the last line is:  ""Includes a list of    Page 109    1   indicators (watch outs) that require further review by    2   Security Director.""    3               Security director is you, is that right?    4        A.    Yes.    5        Q.    Okay. And so what is a list of indicators    6   that require further review?    7        A.    If they sent this to me, I would look at    8   it not only from a security director point of view but    9   a law enforcement point of view. And we had customers    10   in the northeast that didn't appear to be pharmacies    11   at all and yet they were trying to buy our product and    12   somehow had gotten a registration. So we wanted to    13   see exactly where and what the business was. So there    14   are a lot of factors that you -- you look at, and    15   that's exactly what this is.    16        Q.    Okay. And you reference pharmacies. So    17   we are talking about your customer's customer at this    18   point, correct?    19        MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    20   BY THE WITNESS:    21        A.    Our � the distributors sold to    22   pharmacies.    23   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    24        Q.    And part -- and what these � what these    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 28 (106 - 109)     Case: ^^-Qmt^h^t^m.#^W^<^e^'o ^{&&2<WA�9di&@�\9.$t��gkev,    Page 110      Page 112    i bullet points are referencing, though, is it's an   1   trying to make sure we are on the same page.    2 on-site visit to the pharmacy?   2   Q.

Yes, it starts with ""the size"".   19   of their concern, do you agree � well, strike that.    20       A.    ""The size of an order alone, whether or   20   Would you agree that DEA's concern that    21 not it deviates from a normal pattern, is enough to   21   reliance on rigid formulas to define whether an order    22 trigger the registrant's responsibility to report the   22   is suspicious may be failing to detect suspicious    23 order as suspicious.""   23   orders is a valid concern?    24       Q.    And so you would agree that this is the   24   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 33 (126 - 129)     : ^^-Qmt^h^t^m.#^W^<^e^'o ^{&&25&A�9di&@�\9.$t��2&.e    Page 130    i   BY THE WITNESS:    2        A.    I don't know that I agree with that.    3   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    4        Q.    So you � you think it would be fine to    5   rely on a rigid formula?    6        A.    At the time we relied on a rigid formula    7   because there were times we had more information than    8   DEA. A particular registrant, DEA had pulled their    9   registration. So another distributor came in and    io   wanted to order additional product. We knew that. So    ii   to say just because it deviates it's suspicious isn't    12   always the case.    13        Q.    Well, but isn't DEA saying something    14   separate, they are saying that if you are using a    15   rigid formula to define whether an order is suspicious    16   without taking a broader view or looking at more data,    17   you may be failing to detect suspicious orders,    18   isn't � isn't that what DEA is saying in that � in    19   that first two � the first couple of sentences?    20        MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    21   BY THE WITNESS:    22        A.    They are saying this system fails placed    23   by a pharmacy if the pharmacy � see, you're � we are    24   still confusing the manufacturer from the distributor    Page 131    i   to the pharmacy, so. So what you did is you stopped    2   short of reading the rest of the facts that talk about    3   this is � ""This system fails to identify orders    4   placed by a pharmacy if the pharmacy placed unusually    5   large orders from the beginning of its relationship    6   with the distributor."" And you are trying to say, Oh,    7   well, this refers to the manufacturer also when it    8   doesn't say that.    9   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    io       Q.    And so your interpretation of this letter,    ii   then, is that there is nothing wrong with a    12   manufacturer relying on a rigid formula?    13        A.    Again, I'm going to say not necessarily    14   that I agree with that statement because I think it's    15   too rigid. What I'm saying is this is with regard to 16a distributor in pharmacies and you are trying to �    17   to put that on everyone that's a registrant, and I    18  just think that's far reaching.    19        Q.    Well, but the - the - the first page of    20   the letter says, it says; ""This letter is being    21   sent"" � this is at the very top. ""This letter is    22   being sent to every entity in the United States    23   registered with the Dmg Enforcement Administration to    24   manufacture or distribute controlled substances.""    Page 132 i             So this is going to every registrant �    2        A.    It is.    3        Q.    � both manufacturers and distributors?    4        A.    Exactly.    5        Q.    And the statement above relating to rigid    6   formulas, my question to you is: For a manufacturer    7   like Mallinckrodt, is it okay for the manufacturer to    8   rely on rigid formulas in light of this DEA letter?    9        MR. O'CONNOR: Objection. io   BY THE WITNESS:    ii       A.    I don't know if I have an opinion about    12   it.    13   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    14        Q.    You were director of security, sir. You    15   don't have any opinion �    16        A.    No.    17        Q.    � as to whether or not rigid formulas are    18   appropriate with respect to detecting �    19        A.    No.    20        Q.    � suspicious orders?    21        A.    Rigid formulas were used by almost all    22   manufacturing registrants for years. So were they    23   always wrong, is that what you are saying, they have    24   always been wrong? What we are saying is we got a    Page 133    1   great deal of information from that. And from that we    2   were able to determine if it's suspicious. What we    3   were telling DEA is this is a deviation by those rigid    4   numbers from what they've ordered in the past. It was    5   my belief that they would use that information in    6   deciding who they would audit or not audit. So when    7   they are coming out and telling us this, they are    8   saying that now it's your responsibility to � don't    9  just send us this anymore because it's really not    10   helping. So that's the time when we changed and did    11   what DEA required. They are saying, Don't send us    12   rigid numbers any more. But what I'm saying is, I    13   don't agree with the fact that those were wrong.    14        Q.    But you would � you would agree that as    15   of the date of this letter, which is December 2007, it    16   was no longer appropriate to rely on a rigid formula    17   in light of DEA's letter?    is       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    19   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    20        Q.    Is that correct?    21        A.    Well, if we go back � see, you're �    22   you're only taking part of that paragraph, and I just    23   have fault with that. They � it talks about    24   pharmacies. So it's saying, if you read � if the �    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 34 (130 - 133)     Case: ^^-Qmt^h^t^m.#^W^<^e^'o ^{&&2Q&A�9di&@�\9.$t��g7iev,    Page 134      Page 136    1  the distributors, which is different than the   l   said, Okay. And I called Karen in and I said, Pete    2  manufacturers, if they use rigid numbers in doing   2   said don't send those, these monthly letters anymore.    3  this, they may be missing this. So it's not saying   3   So at that point DEA is saying to a    4 just because all registrants received it doesn't   4   manufacturer, Yeah, we don't � we don't want you to    5  necessarily mean that they are talking to the   5   do that anymore. So that is our � when we knew that,    6  manufacturers.   6   that's when our program started to change. We started    7        Q.    Okay. And my question to you then, sir,   7   to fine � to define knowing our customers's customer    8  is: As a manufacturer, when you read this letter, and   8   and we developed that form that gave all of this    9  you read that paragraph, and is it okay if you are a   9   information from those pharmacies so we could make    10  manufacturer to rely on a rigid formula for   10   better decisions. So we were trying to help DEA in    11  identifying suspicious orders?   11   every way, but to say I'm basing that � if I would    12       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   12   have read this at the time, I would have said, Well,    13  BY MR. KAWAMOTO:   13   they are talking about pharmacies, not manufacturers.    14        Q.    I understand that distributors may be   14   Q.    So your interpretation of this letter, I    15  doing something different or they may be differently   15   understand that you had a phone conversation with Pete    16  situated, but with respect to a manufacturer, is it   16   Kleissle, but your interpretation of this letter and    17  okay for a manufacturer like Mallinckrodt to rely on a   17   this paragraph is that this applies to distributors    18  rigid formula to define whether an order is   18   and not manufacturers, is that correct?    19  suspicious?   19   A.    As I read it today, that's what I �    20       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   20   that's how I interpret it. But you have to remember    21  BY THE WITNESS:   21   this is � well, it's only ten years ago, over ten    22        A.    I'll just restate what I said. We   22   years ago.    23  believed giving those numbers to DEA would allow them   23   Q.    But you don't have any reason to believe    24  to audit if they thought � because they have   24   as you sit here today that you would have had a    Page 135      Page 137    1  additional information. They have information from   1   different interpretation of this letter ten years ago?    2  other � other registrants. Maybe that distributor   2   A.    Ten years ago I thought we had a great    3  was buying from five different manufacturers. So, we   3   program in place, so.    4  don't know that. We were providing those numbers to   4   Q.    And what do you believe now, sir?    5  them in an � in an effort to alert them that this is   5   A.    I think our program has improved.    6  a little out of the ordinary. And to say that's just   6   Q.    So you can put that aside.    7  absolutely wrong is just not right.   7   A.    Okay.    8  BY MR. KAWAMOTO:   8   MR. KAWAMOTO: Okay. So this is now Exhibit 9.    9       Q.    Well, I'm � I'm not saying that's   9   (WFIEREUPON, a certain document was    io  absolutely wrong, sir. I'm asking a slightly   10   marked Mallinckrodt-Ratliff    11  different question, which is going forward from 2007   11   Deposition Exhibit No. 009, for    12  onward � I'm sorry � going forward from December   12   identification, as of 12/19/2018.)    13  2007 onward, was it acceptable to rely on a rigid   13   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    14  formula? I'm not asking you about rigid formulas   14   Q.    So this is an e-mail chain from Karen    15  prior to December of 2007. I'm saying, after the date   15   Harper to you with the Bates No. 268860, and the    16  of this letter, would it be appropriate for a   16   bottom e-mail is an e-mail from you, Mr. Ratliff, to a    17  manufacturer to rely on a rigid formula in determining   17   number of people, cc'ing Karen Harper.    i8  whether an order is suspicious?   18   A.    Okay.    19       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   19   Q.    So can you review the bottom e-mail,    20  BY THE WITNESS:   20   please?    21       A.    I received a telephone call from Pete   21   A.    I can.    22  Kleissle at some time, and I don't think it was � I   22   Okay.    23  think it was after this where he said, Yeah, don't do   23   Q.    Okay. So, sir, can you read the top    24  that anymore, don't said those. So at that point I   24   paragraph of your e-mail?    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 35 (134 - 137)     Case: fti^nTf                                                  0?{&&27&te9di&@�\9.$t��2&.ev,    Page 138      Page 140    1       A.    I can.   l   A.    So that � that e-mail sentence suggests    2              ""Jim,"" I guess it's to Jim Rausch, ""Pete   2   that the suspicious � that you were supposed � you    3  Kleissle, DEA Diversion Group Supervisor, St. Louis,   3   were � well, strike that.    4 just called regarding several letters he has received   4   That line suggests that you were sending    5  from you detailing suspicious orders"" � ""suspicious   5   out suspicious or you were filling suspicious orders    6  orders. He advised that he needs more information, in   6   after notifying the DEA of those orders, is that    7  that, if it is suspicious why are we filling the   7   correct?    8  order. I explained that we use a calculation based   8   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    9  on"" � ""upon an amount previously order. He stated,   9   BY THE WITNESS:    io  'If you think it is suspicious, don't fill it.' I   10   A.    No, it is not correct. What he is saying    11  will go into more detail on Friday.""   11   is, I need more information. So what we've used is    12       Q.    Okay. Thank you.   12   that algorithm that we believed was helping them. So    13              So that is an e-mail that you sent to Jim   13   he is saying, Don't do that anymore, but he is not    14  Rausch, Michael Pheney and Cathy Stewart.   14   saying, Oh, yeah, you are sending me this information    15       A.    Um-hum.   15   and it's suspicious. We were providing the    16       Q.    Does this refresh your recollection as to   16   information to them to assist them. So to say that    17  what Jim Rausch � the role Jim Rausch was playing in   17   any of those were suspicious, we don't really � we    18  the suspicious order monitoring program?   18   just know they didn't fit within the algorithm.    19       A.    Yes. Jim works with Pheney and he is�   19   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    2 o  they obviously are the ones that are gathering the   20   Q.    But he also says: ""He advised that he    21  information, I guess, upon what orders are being sent.   21   needs more information that if it is suspicious, why    22  You have to remember, he didn't work for me, so I   22   are we filling the order.""    23  don't have a specific knowledge of what he did.   23   So doesn't that last phrase, ""if it is    24       Q.    I understand that.   24   suspicious why are we filling the order,"" suggest that    Page 139      Page 141    i       A.    Okay. But this is what I was speaking of   1   you were filling suspicious orders?    2 before when Pete called me and said, Don't do that   2   A.    Well, the rest of that conversation with    3  anymore.   3   Pete � sorry, I didn't mean to talk over you. Please    4       Q.    And what you are referring to is Pete   4   repeat yourself.    5 called you and said don't send him any more letters,   5   Q.    Doesn't that phrase ""if it is suspicious    6 is that correct?   6   why are we filling the order,"" doesn't that suggest    7       A.    Yes.   7   that you were filling suspicious orders and he is    8       Q.    And what � what were the letters that Jim   8   asking you why?    9 was sending to Pete?   9   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    i�       A.    They were a � I can't tell you   10   BY THE WITNESS:    ii  specifically, but they had to do with the orders, and   11   A.    That's not what he is � that is not what    12 1 don't know what their calculations were, I don't   12   he related to me. He is just saying, Don't do that    13 know anything about that. I just know that they   13   anymore. If you � if it's the algorithm, if it    14 filled out letters and sent them based on an algorithm   14   doesn't fit, we don't have enough based on what you    15 that had been developed and was being used.   15   are sending us based on your algorithm. And I'll give    16       Q.    Okay. And do you see this � this   16   you more information on Friday about what's going on,    17  sentence that I'm highlighting? Could you repeat   17   so.    is that, please?   18   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    i9       A.    Several letters he has received from me   19   Q.    And so that � that phrase then is    20 detailing suspicious orders. ""He advised that he   20   inaccurate?    21 needs more information, in that, if it is suspicious   21   A.    I would say it's poorly worded on my part.    22 why are we filling the order,"" is that what you are   22   Q.    And when he says: ""He stated, 'If you    23  asking?   23   think it is suspicious, don't fill it,'"" why would    24       Q.    Yes.   24   he � why would he say that � why would he say that    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 36 (138 - 141)     Case: ^TTS^-WR^^d^t^^^^^i^B^o 0?{&&2^te9di&@�\9.$t��2&.ev,    Page 142      Page 144    i  to you? And you have that in quotes, sir.   1   know that.    2       A.    Um-hum.   2   Q.    Sure. But he was clearly running them at    3       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   3   a minimum on some, correct?    4  BY MR. KAWAMOTO:   4   A.    At a minimum on some, but I would think it    5       Q.    Why would he say that to you if he didn't   5   was � the algorithm affected all of the customers.    6 have a concern that you were filling suspicious   6   Q.    Okay. So I understand that you are not    7  orders?   7   sure whether it was all of them or some of them, but I    8       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   8   guess my point is, regardless of whether it was all of    9  BY THE WITNESS:   9   the orders or some of the orders, he was running an    io       A.    I don't believe that Pete believed we were   10   algorithm on these orders and that � that algorithm    ii  filling suspicious orders. If he had believed that,   11   presumably identified various orders.    12  he and his team would have been at Mallinckrodt going   12   Is that your understanding?    13  through all of our records. He was just explaining to   13   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    14  me in a very emphatic way to change what you are   14   BY THE WITNESS:    15  doing. And that came out of headquarters. And so did   15   A.    Yes, if they were � if they were out    16 he say that, yes.   16   of � if they were higher than they had been, if it    17  BY MR. KAWAMOTO:   17   had increased at a certain time, there is a method to    18       Q.    And what did he want you to do � well,   18   all of that. I don't profess to know what it is, but    19  strike that.   19   I know we were doing that, and he was being very    2 o             What were you doing that he had concerns   20   specific about this, about us stopping with the �    21  about?   21   with the algorithms.    22       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   22   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    23  BY THE WITNESS:   23   Q.    Okay. So presumably after April    24       A.    We were using an algorithm, as all of the   24   of 2008 - well, strike that.    Page 143      Page 145    i other registrants were, and he is saying don't use   1   I take it you responded to his direction    2 that.   2   by stopping use of the algorithm, is that correct?    3 BY MR. KAWAMOTO:   3   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    4       Q.    And what did he want you to do instead   4   BY THE WITNESS:    5 then?   5   A.    I think that's what I did with this    6       A.    Provide him more information.   6   e-mail.    7       Q.    So I want to make sure I understand what   7   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    8 you mean by you say you were using an algorithm.   8   Q.    Okay. And so what took its place?    9       A.    Um-hum.   9   Instead of using an algorithm to identify suspicious    i�       Q.    So you were applying a formula to a   10   orders, how did you identify them?    ii group � well, do you know if this algorithm was   11   A.    Well, you'd have to ask Karen Harper. We    12  applied to all of the orders for your opioid products   12   started a new program. I can't tell you the exact    13 or only some?   13   date that we started sending out those forms to    14       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   14   identify all of our � all of the other information.    is BY THE WITNESS:   15   I just don't know the answer to that.    16       A.I don't know that. Jim Rausch would be a   16   Q.    And you reference in the second paragraph    17 better source for that. He is the one that filled out   17   ""Frank Sapienza""?    18 the letters based on the orders that they received,   18   A.    Yes.    19 so.   19   Q.    Who is he?    20 BY MR. KAWAMOTO:   20   A.    He was with DEA.    21       Q.    So Jim is running an algorithm on some   21   Q.    And the reference is, you have a call    22 population of orders?   22   planned with Frank Sapienza on Friday ""to strengthen    23       A.    You're putting words.

I'm just interested in what your   4   know, doing what they should be doing, their due    5  recollection is and that's why we are going through   5   diligence. So that's when we started to develop the    6  these records.   6   form that we are asking our salespeople to go out on    7       A.    Okay. Well, that's my recollection.   7   all of our customers and give us this information so    8  Thank you.   8   we can make the best decision possible so we are    9       Q.    Okay.

So this is an e-mail with several    3  well, strike that.   3   attachments, and why don't we start with the e-mail.    4              Your recollection is that that improvement   4   So if you could review that and let me know when you    5  was knowing your customer's customer, is that correct?   5   are ready.    6       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   6   A.    Okay. I have read that.    7  BY THE WITNESS:   7   Q.    Okay. So this is an e-mail from Karen    8        A.    I can't tell you at this time sitting here   8   Harper to you, Michael Pheney, Jim Rausch, Cathy    9  exactly when the form was developed or when we started   9   Stewart, and Kimberly France.    10  doing that. I just can't tell you that. I just �I   10   A.    Um-hum.    11  have no memory of exactly when that happened.   11   Q.    And it is dated April 10th, 2008. It's    12  BY MR. KAWAMOTO:   12   Bates number is 273902.    13        Q.    Okay.   13   And do you recall receiving this e-mail?    14        A.    But I know that we started to do that.   14   A.    May name is on it, so I must have received    15  And the exact date, I can't � I just can't tell you.   15   it, but I don't recall receiving it.    16  I don't know.   16   Q.    Okay. Now, in this Karen is raising    17        Q.    And what do you recall about the form? I   17   various questions regarding improvements to the    18  mean, this is � we've repeatedly discussed this form.   18   suspicious order checklist.    19  What do you � what do you recall about the form? Who   19   Is that accurate?    2 0  did it go to, what did it ask for, what type of   20   A.    That's what it says.    21  information was it trying to seek?   21   Q.    Okay. And what � what do you recall    22       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   22   about what the suspicious order checklist was?    23  BY THE WITNESS:   23   A.    I don't really recall it at all.    24        A.    I mean, I'd love to see the form and I   24   Q.    Okay. Well, so why don't we look at some    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 40 (154 - 157)     Case: ^TTS^-WR^^d^t^^^^^i^B^o 0?{&&�2<$te9di>im\9.$t��&iev,    Page 158      Page 160    i  of the attachments then, because I believe one of them   l   how we have an obligation to do that. It's � I don't    2  is a � a checklist.   2   know what ""The Integrichain Pilot Program"" is or who    3       A.    Okay.   3   wrote the document. And sometimes they use � they    4       Q.    Actually, two of them are checklists.   4   use words and phrases that aren't necessarily in � in    5       A.    Okay.   5   keeping with a manufacturer. So they are saying,    6       Q.    So the ""Controlled Substance Order   6   whatever this program is that we should be doing that,    7  Checklist,"" that's the first attachment.   7   and we had some � we had people at some point that    8             Do you see that?   8   came in and tried to � tried to provide information    9       A.    I do.   9   that it was their � their project, their pet project.    io       Q.    And just so I understand how this   10   So am I saying that we were � no, I don't think so.    ii  checklist was used, this would be completed by the   11   I don't think that's the job of a manufacturer at all.    12  customer service representative. So this wasn't �   12   Our job is to prevent diversion. But as a growing �    13  this wasn't part of the effort to know your customer's   13   that's somebody's special project and they decided    14  customer, was it?   14   that we should have this obligation. So do I agree    15       A.    I think it was part of the overall �   15   with that, no.    16  excuse me � suspicious order monitoring program. Did   16   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    17  I ever see these, no. Was I aware that there was a   17   Q.    Well, so what part of the obligation do    18  checklist, probably at that time, but I think it was   18   you not agree with, because it says Covidien � I    19 part and parcel to the � to the suspicious order   19   mean, ""As a growing leader in the pain management    2 o  monitoring program. They were trying to bring   20   category, Covidien has a social and business    21  everybody in on the same page.   21   obligation to prevent abuse.""    22       Q.    The next attachment is an overview of   22   Do you agree that there is an obligation    23  something called ""The Integrichain Pilot Program.""   23   to prevent abuse if you are a manufacturer?    24             Do you see that?   24   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    Page 159      Page 161    i       A.    I do see that.   1   BY THE WITNESS:    2       Q.    Do you recall anything about The   2   A.    We have an obligation to prevent    3 Integrichain Pilot Program?   3   diversion, but there is no way as a manufacturer we    4       A.    No.   4   are going to be able to prevent abuse. If down the    5       Q.    The very top paragraph, right underneath   5   line, I'll give you an example, it's in a prison,    6 Background, could you read that for me, please?   6   there is never a perfect system. You are always going    7       A.    ""As a growing leader in the pain   7   to get drugs into a prison. Even � even the most    8 management category, Covidien has a social and   8   hardened prisoners � prisons get contraband into that    9 business obligation to prevent abuse, diversion and   9   prison.

So recognizing that there appears to be a   14   Q.    Okay. So the manufacturer in your opinion    15 word missing, other than that, would you generally   15   does not have any obligation to prevent abuse?    16 agree with that statement?   16   A.    It's our responsibility to prevent    17       A.    I don't know what pharmacovigilance is.   17   diversion.    18       Q.    Well, how about the sentence: ""Asa   18   Q.

So you've got the ""Customer Data    20   Integrity Group.

Page 171    1        A.    After all of these years, I just can't    2   remember it.    3        Q.    You can't remember it.    4        A.    I mean, I just can't remember.    5        Q.    Now, with respect to security director,    6   that would have been you, is that correct?    7        A.    Yes.    8        Q.    Do you recall if � if this was an    9   accurate description of your � of your role in 2008? 10       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    ii   BY THE WITNESS:    12        A.    Again, I can't recall. I just don't know.    13                   (WHEREUPON, a certain document was    14                    marked Mallinckrodt-Ratliff    15                    Deposition Exhibit No. 012, for    16                    identification, as of 12/19/2018.)    17   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    18        Q.    So this is an e-mail from Karen Harper to    19   you. It is entitled ""DEA Compliance Monthly Report,    20   May 2008,"" and it has a Bates number of 2908468. And    21   I only want to ask you about two things, the    22   regulatory interpretations and the suspicious order �    23   well, it says ""Suspicious Order Mentoring."" I suspect    24   that may be a typo.    Page 172    1        A.    Okay. I have read the ""Regulatory    2   Interpretations."" What other?    3        Q.    Okay. The one up top saying ""Suspicious    4   Order Mentoring.""    5        A.    Okay.    6        Q.    Okay. So it says under Suspicious Order    7   Mentoring, I think that means monitoring: ""The team    8   continues work and three meetings were held in May.""    9              Is the � is the reference to the team the    10   SOM team?    11        A.    I � yeah, I don't know.    12        Q.    Okay. And I take it you don't recall    13   anything about meetings being held in May on    14   suspicious order monitoring or mentoring?    15        A.    No.    16        Q.    Okay. Now, the next sentence references    17   a: ""Procedure that is in Draft 3 Revision and a    18   subcommittee which has become work on which algorithms    19   will be used to screen orders of unusual quantity, 2 0   frequency and pattern.""    21        A.    Okay.    22        Q.    So, do you have any recollection of a 2 3   subcommittee ?    24       A.    No.    Page 173    1         Q.    Now, the � the � this is dated June    2   of 2008 and it's referencing work on algorithms which    3   will be used to screen orders of unusual quantity,    4   frequency and pattern.    5               So if you will recall in April of 2008 you    6   had a conversation with Pete Kleissle.    7               Do you recall that?    8         A.    Yes.    9         Q.    And the upshot of that conversation is    io   that you were to stop � well, Jim Rausch was to stop    11   sending him letters and using that algorithm?    12         MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    13   BY THE WITNESS:    14         A.    He said, Don't send us letters using the    15   algorithms.    16   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    17         Q.    Okay.    18         A.    That doesn't mean that the algorithms    19   aren't effective, because that's what they are saying    20   here, I think, that they are � the algorithms have    21   some benefit to us, so that's what I get from reading    22   it. But do I recall it, no.    23         Q.    And so do you have any recollection of    24   whether the algorithm was changed or modified over    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 44 (170 - 173)     : ^TT^-WR^^d^t^^^^^i^B^o 0?{&&�G&A�9di&@�\9.$t�m7ie    Page 174    1   time?    2         A.    I don't.    3         Q.    And actually, you don't � you don't    4   recall whether the algorithm was still being used    5   after April of 2008?    6         A.    I don't. I know that they weren't sending    7   letters to DEA with it.    8         Q.    Going to ""Regulatory Interpretations"" �    9         A.    Okay.    io       Q.    � it says � can you read that first    ii   sentence?    12         A.    ""As newly appointed Dosage Customer    13   Service Manager, Cathy Stewart requested several    14   regulatory interpretations pertaining to DEA 222 over is   shipment and States versus Federal controlled    16   substance laws.""    17         Q.    Do you know what that is in reference to? is       A.    No.    19               Is that all from this?    20         Q.    That's all for that.    21         A.    Thank you.    2 2                  (WHEREUPON, a certain document was    23                     marked Mallinckrodt-Ratliff    24                     Deposition Exhibit No. 013, for    Page 175    1                    identification, as of 12/19/2018.)    2   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    3        Q.    So the questions I have for you, sir,    4   relate to the back page under ""Ongoing Projects,"" and    5   in particular it is the second bullet point.    6        A.    The second bullet?    7        Q.    Yes. The one that I'll - I'll highlight    8   it here.    9               Do you see that highlighted section, sir?    10        A.    Ida    11        Q.    Now, the first sentence references ""HDMA    12   Industry Guidance.""    13               Do you know what that � what is HDMA    14   Industry Guidance?    15        A.    No.    16        Q.    It also references: ""One significant gap    17   will be worked wherein HDMA suggests that the customer    18   (as opposed to shipper's sales rep) fills out the    19   information gathering document regarding business    2 0   background, customer base, state and federal license,    21   and signs and notarizes the statement.""    22               Do you see that statement?    23        A.    I do.    24        Q.    Do you know what that is in reference to?    Page 176    1        A.    I don't.    2        Q.    Okay. Were you � do you recall ever    3   becoming aware of a significant gap in the program?    4        A.    No.    5        Q.    The second line from the bottom, it says,    6   ""Further, HDMA endorses an electronic order monitoring    7   system and we need to determine status (has pilot    8   program been run?)""    9              Well, do you know what HDMA is?    10        A.    I don't.    11        Q.    Okay. And do you know � do you have any    12   recollection of an electronic order monitoring system?    13        A.    At this time I don't. I just don't.    14        Q.    And the last sentence says: ""More work on    15   suspicious order monitoring program will be on the    16   agenda for January.""    17        A.    Okay.    18        Q.    So based on the document, sir, it appears    19   that Mallinckrodt was working on its suspicious order    20   monitoring program since early 2008 until early 2009.    21               Is that accurate?    22        A.    We were constantly refining, reviewing,    23   and improving the suspicious order monitoring program.    24   So if that's what you are saying, yes.    Page 177    1         Q.    But do you have any recollection of when    2   the enhanced or new suspicious order monitoring    3   program was implemented?    4         A.    I believe it was always in a stage of � I    5   mean, it was always being used as it was being    6   reviewed and improved is my recollection.    7         Q.    But you don't � you are not aware or    8   familiar with any of the details of that SOM program    9   as you sit here today?    io       A.    Say that one more time, please.    11         Q.    You are not aware or familiar with any of    12   the details of that SOM program as you sit here today?    13         MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    14   BY THE WITNESS:    15         A.    Was I aware of the suspicious order    16   monitoring program, is that what you are asking?    17   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    18         Q.    No. I'm asking � I'm asking about the    19   specifics of its implementation.    2 o              Do you know whether there was an algorithm    21   in effect? Do you know when the customer checklist    22   was rolled out?    23         MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    24   BY MR.

So your basis for saying that there was    7   always some type of program in effect is what? Is it    8   your general recollection or �    9        A.    Karen.    10        Q.    � why would you say that?    11        A.    Karen would come in from time to time and    12   say, We are going to do this. And I'd go, Okay. She    13   was right next � in the office right next to me. And    14   so was � did that mean did I know at the time, maybe.    15   This is only � we are getting only nine years ago.    16   What I'm saying is would I have known at the time what    17   was going on, yes. But what you are asking me is to    18   review things that I haven't thought about in all of    19   those years and today is the first time I'm looking at 2 0   this in nine years, ten years, eleven years and asking    21   me to recall those details. And I apologize. I    22   can't. I just � my memory is not good enough to go    23   back and look at this and say, Yep, that's what � I    24   just don't remember that.    Page 179 i       Q.

Estates: ""On 4/23/08,1 attended a    18   meeting of the Midwest Controlled Substance Discussion    19   Group in Chicago. Among the agenda items was    20   suspicious order monitoring.""    21               Do you recall whether you attended that    22   meeting as well?    23        A.    I never attended these meetings ever.    24        Q.    What was the Midwest Controlled Substance    Page 200    i   Discussion Group?    2         A.    It's a group of manufacturers that get    3   together and compare notes. They can't talk about    4   quota or manufacture, but they can talk about things    5   like the suspicious order monitoring program, DEA    6   letters and � and different things like that. They    7   can talk about all kinds of stuff. They just have to    8   be careful about not discussing their quota issues and    9   so forth with other registrants.    io       Q.    And can you read this highlighted section    ii   for me, please?    12         A.    ""One member of industry indicated they    13   have received advice from DEA that the suspicious    14   order monitoring program should allow DEA registrants    15   to 'know their customer' and compare that activity to 16a bank's obligation to report $ 10,000 transactions to    17   law enforcement for detection of money laundering    18   while having the ability to detect multiple    19   transactions at 9,999.""    20         Q.    Okay. And can you also read what's    21   underneath it?    22         A.    ""Other suggestions included: On-site    23   visits for all controlled substance customers, close    24   scrutiny of � ""scrutiny of small, independent    Page 201    i   pharmacies, close scrutiny of pain management    2   clinics.""    3         Q.    And so those suggestions, particularly the    4   ""close scrutiny of small independent pharmacies"" and    5   the ""close scrutiny of pain management clinics,"" that    6   would be consistent with knowing your customer's    7   customer, would it not?    8         A.    It would be, but the people that attended    9   this meeting can also be distributors. They don't io   have to just be manufacturers. They are in the ii   industry, so.    12         Q.    But as a � as a general � I mean, well,    13   from your standpoint in terms of the enhancements that    14   Mallinckrodt is seeking to make to its suspicious    15   order monitoring program, that � those types of    16   enhancements, the close scrutiny of small independent    17   pharmacies and close scrutiny of pain management    18   clinics, were things that Mallinckrodt was    19   undertaking, is that correct?    20        MR.

Well, if you read this, it says: ""On-site    23   visits for all controlled substance customers.""    24               I mean, what you are saying is ""all"" and    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 51 (198 - 201)     Case: ^TT^-WR^^d^t^^^^^i^B^o 0?{&&P^te9dilm\9.$t�%Miev,    Page 202      Page 204    i  that's a � I just can't agree with that. There are   l   Mallinckrodt agreed with, did it not?    2  pharmacies all over the United States that are as   2   A.

These are other suggestions included, but    7  pharmacies."" So � ""Close scrutiny of pain management   7   you are saying we agreed to that. I have no reason to    8  clinics.""   8   think that we agreed to that.    9             So what you are saying is the manufacturer   9   Q.    Well, isn't that part of knowing your    io  bypasses the distributor and goes directly to all pain   10   customer's customer though?    ii  management clinics; close scrutiny of small,   11   A.    I don't think so. I mean, how do we know    12  independent pharmacies. I'm not sure you understand   12   that the close scrutiny of small, independent    13  what that means.   13   pharmacies, that they even buy from one of our    14       Q.    Well, I don't know that � I'm not sure   14   distributors. You understand that there are many,    15  that that is what that's saying. I think what if s   15   many distributors and there are many manufacturers and    16  saying is: On-site visits of all controlled substance   16   they a lot of times don't buy our product, they buy    17  customers, and you've indicated that that's �   17   someone else's.    18       A.    Those are suggestions.   18   Q.    But looking at your customer's customer,    19       Q.    � that that may not be feasible.   19   meaning those customers of the customer of    20             But close scrutiny of small, independent   20   Mallinckrodt, looking at that universe, it would make    21  pharmacies, that � that is something that a   21   sense to scrutinize small, independent pharmacies,    22  manufacturer could do, could it not, and isn't that   22   would it not?    23  what Mallinckrodt was doing?   23   MR.

I just � I don't think so    2  BY THE WITNESS:   2   because the thing I have a real hang-up with on-site    3       A.    � suggestions �   3   visits of all controlled substance.

And then close scrutiny of small,    6       A.    � that you can include to � I mean, it   6   independent pharmacies, have you � well, I'm not    7 is not a direct � and you have to remember who is   7   going to ask you a question.    8 meeting. These are manufacturers and distributors   8   In Florida there are literally hundreds    9 meeting, and within that they are saying this is what   9   and hundreds of small, independent pharmacies, and    io we are kind of hearing from DEA that, you know, in a   10   I've been in some of those. And while in there, they    ii perfect world, because when you talk about the bank's   11   say, Well, we deliver or We have a better price or We    12 obligations and then the � their ability � you know,   12   can get this for a customer or They ordered this in    13 9,999, that's a structuring violation. I used to have   13   addition to that. So there is no way I could say they    14  a bank fraud squad and I got those every week, but   14   are doing something nefarious because they are a    is that didn't mean that those people were crooks. That   15   small, independent pharmacy, but to go to every single    16 meant that they had either taken or deposited that   16   one in Florida alone is just � it's beyond how that    17 much money. So you have to at least � do you see   17   would be within anyone's capability, so.    i8 what I'm saying? It's � it's not an absolute. That   18   Q.    But if you had a way to screen the small,    19 program is meant to determine if someone is abusing,   19   independent pharmacies and prioritize certain ones,    20 they're � they're money laundering or selling or   20   then it would make sense to focus on those, would it    21 drugs or some other illicit product, so.   21   not?    22       Q.    But the suggestions for close scrutiny of   22   MR.

But I don't know    22  management clinics, you just looked at the pharmacies?   22   how all of this other is even � even important.    23        A.    Yes.   23   As I told you before, having a bank fraud    24        Q.

I   2   identification, as of 12/19/2018.)    3  thought that having someone at that elevated position   3   BY THE WITNESS:    4  would ensure we had the very best program possible for   4   A.    Which one do you want me to read?    5  an industry leader, and that's what we were, and we   5   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    6  were always striving to have the very best program   6   Q.    Let's see. Actually, why don't we focus    7  possible. So we hired him and he was with us for a   7   on the attachment. So that's � this document is    8  short time. I recommended him to go with another   8   Bates No. 471744 and the attachment is Bates    9 registrant there in St. Louis. And I know that he   9   No. 471750.    io  eventually went over there and did work for them also.   10   A.    Okay.    ii       Q.    And I'm sorry. You indicated that you   11   Q.    So this is an agenda from an August 23rd,    12  were disappointed in him?   12   2011, meeting between you and the DEA at DEA    13       A.    I was hoping that he would have some magic   13   headquarters.    14  bullet, that he would come in and say, Oh, this is   14   A.    Okay.    15  what we are looking at, but he didn't have that. He   15   Q.    And do you see under Expected Attendees    16  took the program we had already written and was   16   that you are listed as an expected attendee?    17  basically copying it over and � and polishing it a   17   A.

I absolutely do.    20  written, so.   20   Q.    Okay.    21       Q.    And so you were looking for him to   21   A.    That was the day they had the earthquake    22  substantively change the program or � I'm not clear   22   in Washington, D.C.    23  on exactly why you were disappointed in him?   23   Q.

Right, because they are large and they �    4  they went, That's well and good, but you really need   4   they buy or they purchase large amounts of product and    5  to do this.

Yes.    12        A.    Yes.   12   Q.    Did that list of 30 pharmacies come from    13       MR.

No, no clue.    9  distributors. Is that accurate or did I misunderstand   9   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    10   you?   10   Q.    Do you know if they had it in 2000?    ii       MR.

It theoretically would have been possible?    23  these three � these big three distributors?   23   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    24       A.    Right, because they are �   24   BY THE WITNESS:    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 57 (222 - 225)     Case: ^TT^-WR^^d^t^^^^^i^B^o 0?{&&P^te9dilm\9.$t��5Piev,    Page 226      Page 228    i       A.    Theoretically, if it was available and if   1   highly confidential, so. So I think we � we used it    2  we knew it was available. The issue is that's   2   at some point well before the 2011.

So, I mean � so, are we talking about    5  customers, that would be valuable to them, and so that   5   2008, 2009 -    6  was unknown to us for a long time because they were   6   A.

To be clear, when you say ""they were   12   A.    Um-hum.    13  protecting confidential information,"" they were   13   Q.    But you don't have any idea how long    14  protecting confidential information within the   14   before then?    15  company; in other words, they were protecting   15   A.

They restricted access to that information   20   A.    I have no idea.    21  to all but need-to-know people within that department.   21   Q.    Did Karen Harper make that decision?    22  So, did they restrict it from Karen and I, one of   22   A.    Karen Harper didn't have the authority to    23  hundreds and hundreds of employees that didn't have   23   make that decision.    24  access to that information. So based on that, yes.   24   Q.    So who would have had the authority then?    Page 227      Page 229    1  But the answer is � and I understood when they   1   A.

Well, the people � I mean, the people    3  competitors will know how much we sell to everyone,   3   ahead of you and Karen Harper would have been the vice    4  and that's really confidential, and I understood why   4   presidents, or I'm just trying to now understand    5  it was confidential. At that time I didn't know that   5   Mallinckrodt's corporate structure?    6  we could glean so much information or we needed to   6   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    7  know or customer's customer. You have to understand   7   BY THE WITNESS:    8  that. Initially I didn't know that, one, we could do   8   A.    I � I literally don't know who possessed    9  that or that it was, you know, acceptable in the -- in   9   the information or who was authorized to release the    10  the manufacturing process with all of the   10   information. That's -- I'm just telling you I don't    11  manufacturers that they could go out and see not only   11   know.    12  to whom they are selling but whom those customers are   12   BY MR.

But prior to 2011, the fact remains that   14   recollection of when you found out about it, or do you    15  you and Karen Harper were not deemed to need to know   15   recall how you found out about it?    16  this information?   16   MR.

But this could have been in 2005, this    22  nan, that's just -- one of the pharmacies � one of   22   could have been in 2007, this could have been in 2009,    23  the distributors had an issue and I know that they   23   you just don't know?    24  pulled some information for us and told us it was   24   MR.

If I wanted to find out the answer to   4   access to this information via Karen Harper?    5 this, who would I ask?   5   A.    You are asking me questions I have no �    6       A.    You'd have to find out who controls the   6   no clue as to who does. I just don't know.    7 chargeback information.   7   Q.    So you've indicated that you do recall    8       Q.    And so in terms of your access to the   8   this August 2011 meeting. Do you have any specific    9 chargeback information, did you have direct access or   9   memories of any other meetings with DEA, or is it this    io did you make a request of someone and they provided   10   one and then you recalled the other one in St. Louis    ii you with the data?   11   from I believe 2010?    12       A.    Karen Harper gave me the information on a   12   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    13  spreadsheet and said, These customers' customers are   13   BY THE WITNESS:    14 buying this, and so I had a spreadsheet that listed   14   A.    I know that we had one where the plant    is  all of the names, okay, of those 30. So, who she   15   manager, Karen Harper and I were summoned to DEA about    16 talked to, where she got that information, but she   16   some issue.    17 provided it to me, and I was on a plane by myself to   17   BY MR.

No. I just remember we went.    20 Florida.   20   Q.    Do you recall roughly when this occurred?    21       Q.    Now, you indicated at some point that   21   A.    I have no clue.    22 Mallinckrodt started using chargeback data in its   22   Q.    And the plant manager would have been who?    23  suspicious order monitoring program, right?   23   A.    His first name was Paul.    24       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   24   Q.    Okay. And I take if you don't recall the    Page 231      Page 233    i BY THE WITNESS:   1   last name?    2       A.    (Nodding head.)   2   A.    No.    3 BY MR. KAWAMOTO:   3   Q.    Okay.    4       Q.    So at that point who had access to this   4   A.    I was lucky to recall Paul.    5 information?   5   Q.    Fair enough.    6       A.    Well, it would have been Karen and if she   6   But at some point you, Karen Harper and    7  shared it with me, you know, the � I'm just really   7   Paul were � I assume DEA summoned you.    8 not trying to be � I just don't remember. It's just   8   Would they � do you know if they summoned    9 been too long ago to say it happened this time or this   9   you to their St. Louis office or �    i� person was present.

No. That was in DC.    13  about highly sensitive information. And so you had   13   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    14  access to it, Karen Harper had access to it, so �   14   Q.    Okay. So you were summoned to DC?    15       A.    And I didn't have direct access. I   15   A.    Um-hum.    16 shouldn't have.   16   Q.    Okay. Do you recall if it had anything to    17       Q.

So Karen � Karen Harper either had direct   19   it was about. I mean, it wasn't an unpleasant    20  access or could get it from someone?   20   meeting.    21       A.    Or she could ask for specific things that   21   Q.    Would you describe the August 2011 meeting    22  she wanted.   22   as an unpleasant one?    23       Q.    Okay.

So, directing your attention to the, I    8  BY MR. KAWAMOTO:   8   guess the second page that says ""Agenda,"" it says:    9       Q.    And you were concerned enough to get on a   9   ""Introduction - Bill Ratliff, Director"" � ""Director    io  plane the next day, is that correct?   10   Security Tyco Healthcare.""    11       MR.

No.    15       Q.    I'm sorry.   15   Q.    Okay. Did you help �    16       A.    We left the night before.   16   A.    I started ""Welcome to the meeting"" and    17       Q.    Yeah, you left earlier?   17   introduced everybody and more than likely I left. I    18       A.    We left �no. The earthquake occurred.   18   had other responsibilities.    19  They closed down the airport for two-and-a-half, three   19   Q.    So you weren't � you weren't involved in    20  hours to make sure that all of the tanks, nothing had   20   the preparation of this PowerPoint �    21  cracked. They had all kinds of issues, but we   21   A.    No.    22  eventually flew out that night to go back to   22   Q.    � to your recollection?    23  St. Louis.   23   A.    No. I'm not knowledgeable enough to    24       Q.    And you flew to Florida from DC or did you   24   prepare this.

And so if you count backwards, right   1  registration and you have a DEA 222, that wasn't � or    2 before the slide that says ""Almost Over,"" you've got   2  not alone adequate in determining whether an order is    3 this slide right here. So it is almost at the very   3  suspicious, that's � if you had those, it would not    4 end.   4  be deemed suspicious, so I don't know if they mixed up    s       A.    Okay.   5  their words or if Karen misspoke. That doesn't sound    6       Q.    And so this is a presentation that �   6 right.    7 well, strike that.   7       Q.    But your understanding is that provided    8             Do you see how it says: ""Refer any phone   8  that the customer had a current DEA registration and    9 calls to me concerning""?   9  it had a � and it provided a 222 form, then its    i�       A.    Say again.   10  orders were not suspicious � were I guess de facto    ii       Q.    The top line says: ""Refer any phone calls   11  not suspicious?    12 to me concerning,"" and then it lists various items?   12       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    13       A.    I am on the wrong page here.   13  BY THE WITNESS:    14       Q.    Okay. So ""Almost Over,"" it is going to be   14       A.    Well, there are a lot of other factors    15 the page right before.   15  that go into that, so I'm not in a position to tell    16       A.    ""Refer any phone calls""?   16  you that that's � makes it not suspicious. I don't    17       Q.    Yeah, ""Refer any phone calls to me   17  know that, so. You know, I know I was there at the    18 concerning.""   i8  presentation. I talked a little bit about security.    19             Do you know who the ""me"" is, is that �   19>  And Karen talked about the rest of this because I'm    20       A.    That would be Karen.   20  not knowledgeable enough to really talk about it, so.    21       Q.    Okay.   21  I would ask her about that specific statement if it    22                  (WHEREUPON, a certain document was   22  were me.    23                  marked Mallinckrodt-Ratliff   23  BY MR.

It is dated June 6th, 2008, and it is   4  not suspicious or it's not suspicious?    5  419956.   5       A.    No. Those things are necessary to process    6       A.    Okay.   6  an order and then a lot of other things go into it,    7       Q.    If I could direct your attention to the   7    SO.    8  highlighted portion of this e-mail.   8       Q.    So even if you have the registration    9             Can you please read that for me?   9  statos and a valid 222 form, that's not the end of the    10       A.

KAWAMOTO:    4         Q.    So this is a document Bates numbered    5   307322. It's entitled ""Global Controlled Substance    6   Compliance Procedure,"" and the subject is ""Suspicious    7   Order Monitoring Customer Audit Program.""    8         A.    Okay.    9         Q.    Mr. Ratliff, were you involved with this, io   in the customer audit program?    11         A.    Yes.    12         Q.    And what was your role in it?    13         A.    On occasion I assisted Karen Harper with    14   conducting audits of our distributors.    15         Q.    And by ""assisting,"" what do you mean by    16   that?    17         A.    We would travel to that distributor    18   together or she would fly in and I would be there from    19   another area and we would then do the audits.    20         Q.    And what did you look for when you were    21   conducting the audits?    22         A.    We had to provide their book or however    23   they con � they had their suspicious order monitoring    24   program, if it was in a box or if � whatever it was,    . 0?{&&�^te9dilm\9.$t��&iev,    Page 248    1   but normally they had books that they would present    2   and they would � Karen would go through the books and    3   I would be there and we would look at certain things    4   and we would ask questions about how they identified    5   their customers and that's pretty much it. I mean,    6   there were � we'd ask a number of questions, so.    7        Q.    What was the information that was    8   contained in these books?    9        A.    It was basically that � in an attempt to    10   show they were in compliance with the � with the    11   regulation requiring the � they were preventing    12   diversion, so, it was basically their program.    13        Q.    And the revision date is 1/04/2011.    14               Do you recall when you started conducting    15   these audits?    16        A.I don't. But I believe it was before    17   that, would be my guess. I shouldn't guess. I can't    18   be accurate to know exactly when we started, but...    19        Q.    Do you have a rough sense of how far    20   before 2011 these started?    21        A.    The first audit � there were two audits    22   and they were both in Cincinnati. So if we could    23   detail that date, then I would know when it started.    24        Q.    And do you recall who was being audited?    Page 249    1         A.    Well, it was the Masters, maybe, and �    2   and I don't remember the other name.    3         Q.    And how were you identifying which    4   distributors to audit?    5         A.    Karen identified them and I went along to    6   assist.    7         Q.    Okay. And do you recall how often a    8   distributor was audited, were they put on a cycle or    9   was it based on some other metric? io       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection. ii   BY THE WITNESS:    12         A.    These were the first audits that I was    13   involved in, so if they conducted other audits, I    14   don't know that.    is   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    16         Q.    Do you recall any distributors that failed    17   their audits?    is       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    19   BY THE WITNESS:    20         A.    I think Masters and the other one. There    21   were some issues that we needed to address, so. I    22   don't know that that's a pass/fail.    23   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    24         Q.

You have doctors, you have    2  persons � or Karen conducted the audit and so this   2   the number of orders, you have the total quant �    3  would have been in her possession, so.   3   quantity and equivalent API.    4                 (WHEREUPON, a certain document was   4   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    5                  marked Mallinckrodt-Ratliff   5   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    6                  Deposition Exhibit No. 038, for   6   Q.    And you know the � the measure for total    7                  identification, as of 12/19/2018.)   7   quantity and equivalent APIs, is that essentially the    8  BY MR. KAWAMOTO:   8   number of pills?    9       Q.    So this is another e-mail exchange with an   9   A.    I'm still trying to figure out what the    i o  attachment.   10   chart says.    ii       A.    Yep.   11   Q.    Okay.    12       Q.    Sunrise Chargeback Summary. The Bates   12   A.    What's all of the information at the    13  number is 290041. And it is from Cathy Stewart to you   13   bottom?    14  and Karen, among others. And then at the top e-mail   14   Q.    I think that is a comparative analysis of    15  it says: ""Cathy, Here's the other file....the doctor   15   the API for the different doctors.    16  in question is in column CX.""   16   A.    Say that again.    17             And if you look at the attachment, sir,   17   Q.    I believe that on the assumption that the    i8  which I believe starts on � starts on Bates   18   total quantity and equivalent API is the measure of    19 No. 290042, it appears to be a breakdown of the   19   essentially the pills that these doctors have been    2 o  doctors along with the comparative amount or the   20   ordering, the chart is going to be the differing �    21  relative amount that they are purchasing or obtaining   21   the differing volumes of pills that each doctor has    22  from Sunrise.   22   ordered. That's my reading of the chart.    23             Is that accurate?   23   A.    So you are saying one has purchased 10    24       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   24   million pills?    Page 311      Page 313    1  BY THE WITNESS:   1   Q.    I believe so. Where do you see that?    2       A.    I don't know that I � I don't know really   2   A.    Well, on the side where the numbers are,    3 what this says, just so you know, what the documents   3   when you look at the chart, it is over 10 million.    4  say. You are saying that they are � I just want to   4   Q.    Yes, I believe that means that they    5 be clear before I say yes or no.   5   purchased 10 million in equivalent API.    6             You are saying that this identifies the   6   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    7 doctors, is that what you are saying?   7   BY THE WITNESS:    8 BY MR. KAWAMOTO:   8   A.    So how does the chart below compare to the    9       Q.    Yes. This attachment.   9   above, how do you separate that?    io       A.    So all of these pages?   10   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    ii       Q.    I believe so. If you look at row one, I   11   Q.    Well, I think the - I think Beretsky, for    12 believe those are the last names of doctors.   12   example, you have got four orders for 702,000. I    13       A.    Row one. I'm trying to find row one, so.   13   think that's his little block.    14       Q.    Well, I'm sorry. Let me help you out with   14   A.    Okay. Okay. I can read that, but what    is that, okay. So if you look on the Elmo, I think those   15   does this at the bottom mean?    16 are doctors.   16   Q.    I think that is a visual depiction of the    17       A.    So they would be B, C, D, E, is that what   17   total quantity and equivalent API that these doctors    is you are saying?   18   are obtaining.    19       Q.    Yes.   19   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    20       A.    Okay. So let-   20   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    21       Q.    One doctor is in B, another doctor is in   21   Q.    And I think if you look at Bates number �    22 C, and another doctor is in D.   22   I believe if you can turn to page Bates No. 290048,    23       A.    Okay. I've got that.   23   sir, and it's got a � it would be column CX.    24             So you've identified those as doctors?   24   A.    CX, okay.

KAWAMOTO:    2       A.    Yes.   2   Q.    Moving over to CW, do you see that column?    3       Q.    And do you see that there underneath it is   3   A.    I do.    4 one and 612,000?   4   Q.    It's Shook, right?    5       A.    Okay.   5   A.    Yes.    6       Q.    So I believe that means one order for 612   6   Q.    And do you see the volume � or the volume    7  API?   7   of API?    8       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   8   A.    If that's what that means, API -    9 BY MR. KAWAMOTO:   9   Q.    Okay. So what � what is the volume    io       Q.    612,000 API?   10   indicated there?    ii       A.    Yeah. I don't know how to read the chart,   11   A.    So you are saying it's API. I don't know    12  so I'm going to have to go with � I don't know what   12   that. It says ""12,597,000.""    13 to say. I've never seen this before that I remember,   13   Q.    Well, do you know what API means?    14  and I don't really know what it's stating or how I   14   A.    Active pharmaceutical ingredient.    15  should have been involved in this, so.   15   Q.    Okay. So is that essentially a measure of    16       Q.    Well, but it does indicate for � I mean,   16   pills?    17 these are � you would agree these are the customers'   17   MR.

I'm trying to see on here where it    20 BY THE WITNESS:   20   specifies that that's API. I -    21       A.    Okay. I � okay. I � if that's what you   21   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    22  are saying, okay.   22   Q.    Well, fair enough.    23 BY MR. KAWAMOTO:   23   If you turn to the first page, that's    24       Q.    Well, isn't that a plausible   24   going to be 209942.    Page 315      Page 317    1 interpretation of the e-mail on this chart? I mean �   1   Do you see that?    2       A.    Well, it's plausible. I'm just saying   2   A.    Okay.    3 that I don't know that to be a fact is what I'm   3   Q.    And do you see that notation? I'm sorry.    4  saying.   4   It is a little blurry, but �    5       Q.    Okay. But if you � assuming this   5   A.    Total quantity equivalent to API in column    6 cover �   6   three.    7       A.    Should we have known every one of these   7   Q.    Well, row three?    8 customers, did we run a thing at the time, so the   8   A.    Row three.    9 answer is I don't know now, so.   9   So you are saying that corresponds with    i�       Q.    So next to Schultz, do you see column CW?   10   Schultz and Shook or �    11 Well, actually, let me step back.   11   Q.    Yes. So that-    12             So column CX is Schultz. Did you ever   12   A.    So the column then, again, would be �    13 recall hearing about a Dr. Schultz?   13   Q.    The value for � the value for row three    14       A.    I lost the page now, so.   14   for Shook is as you indicated �    is       Q.    The page is 290048.   15   A.    Okay.    16       A.    Okay.   16   Q.    - 12 million?    17       Q.    So column CX with Dr. Schultz.   17   A.    I'll go with that.    is       A.    Um-hum.   18   Q.    Okay.    19       Q.    Do you ever recall �   19   A.    I understand.    20       A.    This is ten years ago. No.   20   Q.    So Shook is getting 12,597,000, you know,    21       Q.    Okay.

So your understanding or recollection,   21   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    22 though, is that Sunrise passed its audit?   22   BY THE WITNESS:    23       A.    I don't remember that. I don't know.

Do you recall the e-mail where Victor    13   Borelli said the justification for their increase in    14   orders is because they were expanding to other states?    15   Do you recall that, sir?    16        A.I recall reading that, yes.    17        Q.    Okay. Does that appear accurate based on    18   this chargeback data?    19        MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    20   BY THE WITNESS:    21        A.    Based on the chargeback data, it would    22   not.    23   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    24        Q.    So once � so it appears that Victor was    Page 327    1   saying whatever he needed to do to make a sale, is    2   that fair?    3        MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    4   BY THE WITNESS:    5        A.    That's not for me to judge, so.    6   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    7        Q.    But that's what the data suggests, sir,    8   isn't it?    9        MR. O'CONNOR: Objection. io   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    11        Q.    Sir, they shipped 99.7 percent of their    12   product to Florida. That was 49 mil � 49 million    13   plus of UOM, which I assume had some relationship to    14   pills, and they passed an audit. They passed    15   Mallinckrodt's audit.    16               Doesn't that suggest problems with your    17   audit system?    18        MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    19   BY THE WITNESS:    20        A.    So you have two different sheets. And so    21   you are doing Oxycodone HCL 15-milligram tablets. So    22   you are combining those for Florida?    23   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    24        Q.    Yes.    Page 328    1        A.    So it's not all just oxy 30s.

And they � their order was for 3,000    6   bottles of oxy 15 starting January of 2009, sir.    7              Do you recall that?    8        MR.

Um-hum.    15        Q.    � both how Mallinckrodt decided to do    16   business with them and how Mallinckrodt responded when    17   it started receiving information regarding them, and,    18   you know, and the fact that Mallinckrodt did an audit    19   of Sunrise and they presumably passed.    20              So my question to you, sir, is doesn't    21   this suggest a problem with Mallinckrodt's screening    22   of its customers and its audit process?    23        MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    24   BY TIffi WITNESS:    Page 329    1        A.    You are talking about one distributor.    2   BY MR. KAWAMOTO:    3        Q.

Various charts, I'm not certain what that    3  them that it was my fault, that we did it, and I would   3   means.

And then looking at starting on    19       Q.I know it looks bad that there is so many   19   this Page 4022, that ends in 4022, it looks like there    20  but that's because I brought five copies, so it is not   20   are a whole bunch much pharmacies on there that are    21  as bad as it looks.   21   also not in Florida.    22       A.    That's fine.   22   Do you see where I am referring?    23       Q.    Okay. I'm going to hand you what we are   23   A.

Okay. And then based on that, there were   24   are located in Tennessee.

Riggs Drug.   17   Q.    Okay. Have you ever � do you recall    is       A.    I found that. Okay.   18   seeing ever a chart that has on the various    19       Q.

And do you recall having these    22 other pages, and I won't spend the time going through   22   reports run as being part of a diversion prevention    23 each one, I would submit to you that there are various   23   program?    24 other pharmacies in Tennessee.   24   MR.

It appears that these are Karen's notes.    2       Q.    That is your handwriting, sir, the   2   BY MS. HERZFELD:    3  handwriting?   3   Q.    Where it says ""Karen Harper's Notes""?    4       A.    Itis.   4   A.    Yes.    5       Q.    And what does it say?   5   Q.    Okay. So in Karen Harper's notes, it    6       A.

Do you see    9  I'm saying ""Need to visit,"" they need to visit this   9   where it says: ""Karen Harper's Notes""?    10  based on what we read here or what I read.   10   A.    I do.    11       Q.    Okay. When you said ""take this sheet with   11   Q.    Okay. And so �    12  us,"" take this sheet with us where?   12   A.

Okay. And so you�   16   A.    From AmerisourceBergen compliance.    17       A.    And so, ""Karen Harper notes: Customer   17   Q.    So they had not visited �    18   since... risk based...""   18   A.    Right.    19             We received a lot of this information, so,   19   Q.    � that pharmacy?    2 0  from them, and I'm � it has just been so long ago.   20   A.

But the   22   non-controlled than controlled. So that's a low    23  thing that's � I was having difficulty with is I've   23   amount for a pharmacy, and I think that's why they    24  never been to Newport, Tennessee.   24   were saying it was a medium risk.

So you considered 29.4 percent    2   controlled to non-controlled to be a low number?    3         A.    That's less than a third of what they    4   purchase.    5         Q.    So that's considered a low number?    6        A.    Yes.    7         Q.    Okay. And then it says: ""No site visits    8   from compliance.""    9               Was that a problem?    io       MR.

So when you say:  ""This customer    5   has been difficult when it comes to responding to    6   questionnaire,"" that means ABC has been difficult, not    7   Jabos?    8         A.    Right.    9         Q.    Okay. And:  ""Other than numbers, ABC has io  no issue with them.""    11               What � do you know what was concerning    12   about the numbers, if you say 29.4 percent of    13   controlled to non-controlled is low?    14         MR.

I don't.   5   MR. O'COMSfOR: Objection.    6       Q.    Okay. Is that something that's supposed   6   BY THE WITlffiSS:    7  to be checked off there?   7   A.    Correct.    8       MR.

Correct.    18  supposed to visit at the customer's facility to assess   18   BY MS. HERZFELD:    19  the clientele, check the out-of-state license plates   19   Q.    Okay. And here it says that: ""ABC    20  and long lines.   20   Compliance performs some pharmacy on-site inspections""    21             That's to check for signs of diversion, is   21   but ""not all pharmacies are visited,"" so they are not    22  that correct?   22   looking for diversion at all pharmacies that are on    23       MR.

Okay. And why is that?    6  ""no"" on this audit checklist, is that correct?   6   A.    Well, because it is easier for us to read.    7       A.    It appears not.   7   Q.    Okay.    8       Q.    Okay. Then the next question says: ""Does   8   A.

If it's the one that says Masters?    15  file name on this document was: ""May 2012 Top Oxy 30   15   Q.    Yes, sir.    16  Pharmacies."" If you look down, they are classified by   16   A.

And if you look at the second page and you   19   A.    So that would probably �    20  get to where it says ""Tennessee,"" if you'll take a   20   Q.    And do you know �    21  look with me there, sir, it should be on the last   21   A.    � as I say, I can't recall it, but that    22  page.   22   would certainly be a reason.    23              Do you see where I am at?   23   Q.    Okay. And do you know if that pharmacy    24        A.    I have never seen it before.   24   was ever restricted?    Page 427      Page 429    1        Q.    That's okay.   1   A.    I don't know that.    2              So down on Tennessee, there is a couple of   2   Q.    Okay.    3  different ones that are highlighted yellow. Do you   3   A.    This says: ""Date Created: 7/17.

So one is AmerisourceBergen and the other   9   Okay. Almost, almost done.    10  is DBS Trading, Inc. Masters Pharmacy.   10   A.    Okay.    11              Do you see that?   11   Q.    Okay.

Well, the thing I don't know is, is this    4 for chargeback says: ""Bradley Drug Company.""   4   all of the products they purchased from us, is it one    5             Do you see where it says that?   5   particular product they purchased from us?

If it's a � and especially when you are    12             And then some of this stuff here is in red   12   looking at the length of time, so it's a full year,    13  and it looks like their total oxy 15 �   13   you'd have to give me more information to be able    14       A.    Uh-huh.   14   to � to substantiate what you are saying because I    15       Q.    � shipment for, it says the past   15   can't based on what I see here.    16  12 months�   16   Q.    Okay.

Yeah.   17   information.    is       Q.    - through June 2012 is 87,400.   18   So if you look at the top of this sheet,    i9             Do you know what that is, units?   19   it says ""Oxy 15,"" so it looks like it is for that    20       A.    I was retired, I believe, at this time.   20   product.    21       Q.    I believe this covers a year's worth back   21   Do you see at the very top?    22 through July of 2011.   22   A.    Tennessee only � or oxy 15s and 30s    23             Were you still employed in July 2011?   23   through June 20- � okay. So that's �    24       A.    I was in'11, yes.   24   Q.    This sheet says �    Page 431      Page 433    i       Q.    Okay. So I'm looking at those numbers   1   A.    - both of the -    2 there, 87,400 is � do you see that?   2   Q.    � oxy 15, do you see?    3       A.    Okay.   3   A.    What's that?    4       Q.    Do you know if that's tablets or bottles?   4   Q.    This sheet says: ""Sheet: Oxy 15""?    5       A.    I don't know.   5   A.    Doesn't it say and 30s through June �    6       Q.    Okay.   6   Q.    I think that's the file name because the    7       A.    And part of it is when I was retired, so.   7   next one I'm going to show you is oxy 30. I have    8       Q.    Correct. I understand that.   8   another one. So, look, see where it says at the    9             Part of it was when you were there and   9   top �    i� part of it was when you were not?   10   A.

Okay.   12   June 2012,"" and it says, ""Path:/suspicious order    13             And then looking down, the one that   13   monitoring/distributor information, Sheet:"", the sheet    14 said � next to No. 5, it says Rippetoe, Inc.?   14   here �    is       A.    Yes.   15   A.    Oh.    16       Q.    Morristown, Tennessee?   16   Q.    � ""oxy 15 Tennessee?""    17       A.    I see it.   17   Do you see that?    18       Q.    And if you look all of the way over to the   18   A.    Okay.    i9 end, it says 59,200 units, whatever those are, right,   19   Q.    Okay. So it appears that this is the    28 for 12 months.   20   chargeback data for oxy 15s from pharmacies in    21             Do you see where I am at?   21   Tennessee, is that correct?    22       A.    I do see that.   22   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    23       Q.    Okay. And does that seem like a high   23   BY THE WITNESS:    24 number to you?   24   A.    Based on what you are telling me because I    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 109 (430 - 433)     Case: k�7jmd/0�f&$S&n�>9�fr 19�fli^    Page 434      Page 436    i didn't deal with this information.   l   Q.    Okay. So if the population of a town    2  BY MS. HERZFELD:   2   where a pharmacy is located is 29,137 people, yet the    3       Q.I understand. If you'll just be patient   3   number of oxys are 59,200 being supplied by    4 with me, too, because it took me kind of a minute.   4   Mallinckrodt, does that seem high to you?    5             Okay. So looking at that and knowing that   5   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    6 it's oxy 15 and the number for the Rippetoe Pharmacy   6   BY THE WITNESS:    7 in Morristown, Tennessee is 59,200, if I told you �   7   A.    There is no way I'd know. Is this the    8 well, first, did you ever take into consideration the   8   only pharmacy in town? I don't know that.    9 population of any particular areas when evaluating   9   BY MS. HERZFELD:    io potential suspicious orders?   10   Q.    Does that matter?    ii       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   11   A.    If it's the only pharmacy in town, it    12  BY THE WITNESS:   12   might.    13       A.    Personally, I � I don't recall taking in   13   Q.    Okay.    14 the population, so.   14   A.    I mean, are they supplying the hospital,    15  BY MS. HERZFELD:   15   are they supplying, you know, multiple doctors, how    16       Q.    Okay. And do you know if anyone at   16   many � you know, I just don't know. What's the aging    17 Mallinckrodt did?   17   population of that area? I don't know that, so.    is       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   18   Q.    Okay. So would that information cause you    19  BY THE WITNESS:   19   to do a deeper inquiry, do you think it should have    20       A.    So, are you asking do we know the   20   flagged an inquiry?    21 population of Morristown, Tennessee?   21   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    22  BY MS. HERZFELD:   22   BY THE WITNESS:    23       Q.    No, no. I'm just asking if you know if   23   A.    I just don't know that.    24  anybody considered the populations where particular   24   BY MS. HERZFELD:    Page 435      Page 437    1  pharmacies were located in looking for suspicious   1   Q.    Okay.    2  orders?   2   Okay. Let's go then to the next one, the    3       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   3   one next to No. 10 is Jabos Pharmacy, the one we've    4  BY THE WITNESS:   4   talked about before, in Newport, Tennessee.    5       A.    That's not the way we � we did things.   5   Have you ever been to Newport, Tennessee,    6  We � we had distributors there to do it. We   6   sir?    7  identified their major purchasers there, our   7   A.    Not to my knowledge.    8  customers' customers, and we did look at those people.   8   Q.    Okay. And that one appears to have 42,000    9  So, did we look at the size of the town, I don't know   9   units of oxy 15.    io  that we did that, so.   10   A.    Um-hum.    11  BY MS. HERZFELD:   11   Q.    Do you know what the population is of    12       Q.    Okay. You don't specifically recall doing   12   Newport, Tennessee?    13   it?   13   A.    I have no idea.    14       A.    Correct.   14   Q.    Okay. If I told you that the population    15       Q.    Okay. So back to the Rippetoe Pharmacy   15   of Newport, Tennessee � well, that Newport,    16 here in Morristown, Tennessee, it has like the third   16   Tennessee, first off, is in Cocke County, which is    17  highest number for this time period for the oxy 15s at   17   very rural, do you know that?    is 59,200.   18   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    19             Did you know that the population of   19   BY THE WITNESS:    20  Morristown, Tennessee is 29,137 during that year?   20   A.    There is no way I would know that. I have    21       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   21   never been there, so.    22  BY THE WITNESS:   22   BY MS. HERZFELD:    23       A.    No.   23   Q.    Okay. So if I tell you that Newport,    24  BY MS. HERZFELD:   24   Tennessee has a population of 6,833 people as of the    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 110 (434 - 437)     Case: k�7jmd/0�f&$S&n�>9�fr ^9�M7e�^    Page 438      Page 440    1  2010 census, would that at all impact your opinion of   l   A.    Well, we -    2  whether 42,000 units of oxy 15s at the Jabos Pharmacy   2   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    3  in Newport, Tennessee was concerning?   3   BY THE WITNESS:    4       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   4   A.    -- we inquired into Jabos when we were at    5  BY THE WITNESS:   5   McKesson � or not McKesson, but AmerisourceBergen,    6       A.    So, didn't they all � already cancel   6   so.    7  Jabos?   7   BY MS. HERZFELD:    8  BY MS. HERZFELD:   8   Q.    But you didn't know the population of    9       Q.    I'm just asking, sir, if that's a flag for   9   Newport, so that wasn't something that was taken into    io  you?   10   consideration, was it?    11       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   11   A.    No.    12  BY THE WITNESS:   12   Q.    Okay. So moving on to the next one,    13       A.    It is and it may be why they were   13   you've got No. 21, East Tennessee Discount Drag in    14  cancelled. I don't know.   14   Strawberry Plains, Tennessee.    15  BY MS. HERZFELD:   15   Do you see where we are at?    16       Q.    Okay. Do you know that that's why they   16   A.    I do.    17  were cancelled?   17   Q.    Okay.

I'm saying it's � that seems based on the   20   Q.    -- of oxy 15 --    21  population of 6,000,1 mean, so.   21   A.    Okay.    22       Q.    It seems high?   22   Q.    -- for the year from East Tennessee    23       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   23   Discount Drag.    24  BY THE WITNESS:   24   Do you see where I am at?    Page 439      Page 441    1       A.    I mean, it seems high, yeah.   1   A.    I do see it.    2  BY MS. HERZFELD:   2   Q.    Okay. And do you know what the population    3       Q.    Okay. So could that be an indicator of �   3   is of Strawberry Plains, Tennessee?    4  of a diversion to you?   4   A.    I don't.    5       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   5   Q.    Okay. If I told you that the population    6  BY THE WITNESS:   6   of Strawberry Plains is 4,667 people, do you think it    7       A.    I don't know that and I can't speculate,   7   should have merited some inquiry that there are 24,900    8    SO.   8   oxy 15s going into that pharmacy?    9  BY MS. HERZFELD:   9   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    io       Q.    Okay. So if you've got one pharmacy in a   10   BY THE WITNESS:    11  tiny rural town that's supplying 42,000 15 oxys �   11   A.    By AmerisourceBergen, yes.    12  42,000 oxy 15s for a population in that town of 6,833,   12   BY MS. HERZFELD:    13  do you think that could indicate that there is a pill   13   Q.    Okay. But not by Mallinckrodt?    14  mill?   14   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    15       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   15   BY THE WITNESS:    16  BY THE WITNESS:   16   A.    Not necessarily. We take the information    17       A.    I don't know that, but are they supplying   17   that they provide us initially to try to make a    18  the whole county? I mean, you'd have to understand   18   determination if they are � if they are doing due    19  that counties sometimes have larger populations than a   19   diligence.    20  town, so.   20   BY MS.

So going over these three    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 111 (438 - 441)     Case: k�7jmd/0�f&$S&n�>9�fr ^9�Sii>^    Page 442      Page 444    1  pharmacies that we just talked about, Rippetoe, Jabos   l   A.

Yeah, okay.    4  those areas that there should have been some red flags   4   Yeah, that's � again, we don't know how    5  for diversion inquired into?   5   many pharmacies are there. We don't know if they are    6       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   6   supplying the whole county. You know, I...    7  BY THE WITNESS:   7   Q.    But you would have liked answers to those    8       A.    Are you saying by � by Mallinckrodt?   8   questions?    9  BY MS. HERZFELD:   9   A.    Yeah, it would have been nice.    io       Q.    Let's start with by the distributors.   10   Q.    Okay. To your knowledge, nobody � nobody    11       MR.

Okay. If you'll give me just one moment.    14       Q.    Okay.   14   Okay. Last one and then we are done.    15       A.    I mean, that's their job to have a program   15   No. 57?    16  to prevent diversion. If they are selling that many   16   A.    56.    17  tablets into a tiny little town, it may be that's why   17   Q.    56. Gosh, I'm always off on this.    18  they were slow in getting us the information. I don't   18   (WHEREUPON, a certain document was    19 know.   19   marked Mallinckrodt-Ratliff    20       Q.

Page 443      Page 445    1   ""know your customer's customer"" to us, not initially,   1   Do you see that at the top?    2  so there are a lot of customers' customers, so.   2   A.    I do.    3       Q.    Okay. And if at that point you had known   3   Q.    Okay. So all of that information we just    4  your customer's customer, would that have been a red   4   went through, let's go through it again, but not quite    5  flag for you for diversion for East Tennessee Discount   5   as long.    6  Drug?   6   No. 5 there talks about Rippetoe Pharmacy    7       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   7   in Morristown. Do you see where I am at?    8  BY THE WITNESS:   8   A.    I do.    9       A.    We would have liked to have had additional   9   Q.    Okay. And it says there that there are    io  information.   10   224,100 units of oxy 30 from Tennessee during that    11  BY MS. HERZFELD:   11   time, is that correct?    12       Q.    Okay. But to your knowledge, nobody   12   A.    It is.    13  considered the population factor, is that correct?   13   Q.    Okay. And Bradley Drug had 212,700 units    14       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   14   of oxy 30?    15  BY THE WITNESS:   15   A.    So, that � you are saying that's for a    16       A.    Correct.   16   whole year?    17  BY MS. HERZFELD:   17   Q.    Yes, sir.    18       Q.    Okay. And the same for Jabos Pharmacy?   18   A.    So -    19       MR. O'CONNOR: Same objection.   19   Q.    Yes.    20  BY THE WITNESS:   20   A.    So divide it up 12 months, it would be �    21       A.    Did we talk about how many people were in   21   and the number of pills in a bottle, I know you � it    22  Newport?   22   seems excessive when you just look at the number, but    23  BY MS. HERZFELD:   23   that's for 12 months.    24       Q.    Yes, we did, sir.   24   Q.    Okay. So let's look at No. 9, Jabos    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 112 (442 - 445)     Case: k�7jmd/0�f&$S&n�>9�fr 19�M7e�re^    Page 446      Page 448    1  Pharmacy in Newport.   1   or a lot of customers that buy a lot more than that,    2       A.    Okay.   2   and if it's for a whole year, it doesn't seem unusual    3       Q.    160,800, and we just talked about the   3   to us, so what you are saying is it's a little tiny    4  population of Jabos. Should that have been concerning   4   town and you should have known that. Well, if you    5  to Mallinckrodt?   5   look at it for a whole year, it doesn't seem nearly as    6       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   6   large as what you are saying, so.    7  BY THE WITNESS:   7   Q.    Don't you think somebody should ask those    8       A.    For an entire year?   8   questions, though?    9  BY MS. HERZFELD:   9   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    io       Q.    Yes, sir.   10   BY MS. HERZFELD:    11             The population �   11   Q.    You said all of these questions, how many    12       A.    I'm not-   12   elderly people, how big is the county �    13       Q.    � of Newport we just discussed was 6,833   13   A.    Yeah.    14  people?   14   Q.    � how many hospitals, don't you think    15       A.    Right, right.   15   somebody should have asked those questions?    16       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   16   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    17  BY MS. HERZFELD:   17   BY THE WITNESS:    18       Q.    Did that merit further inquiry for   18   A.    The distributor should have asked that.    19 potential diversion, sir?   19   BY MS. HERZFELD:    20       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   20   Q.    Okay. But not Mallinckrodt?    21  BY THE WITNESS:   21   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    22       A.    For a whole year for 160,000 tablets, not   22   BY THE WITNESS:    23  necessarily.   23   A.    We look at this number and it's not that    24  BY MS. HERZFELD:   24   large. Had we looked behind and said, Okay. Let's    Page 447      Page 449    i       Q.    Not for a town with a population of 6,833   1   just figure out for this one customer, you have to    2 people?   2   remember there are � our distributors have thousands    3       A.    Well, I didn't know the population, but   3   of customers, okay.    4 you need to tell me population of the county.   4   BY MS. HERZFELD:    5       Q.    Okay, sir.   5   Q.    Yes, sir.    6       A.    Because not everybody lives in the city.   6   A.    And so we have to go through every one of    7       Q.    Okay. Sir, if I tell you Cocke County is   7   them and determine the size of the town and then    8 very rural, does that make a difference?   8   divide out how much they got for a whole year and how    9       MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.   9   many people live in the county, how many are elderly    io BY THE WITNESS:   10   and how � you know, I know what you are saying, but    ii       A.    Do you know how many people live there in   11   it's not nearly as big a red flag as you are making it    12 the county?   12   to be, in our � in my opinion. In your opinion, you    13 BY MS. HERZFELD:   13   are doing an admirable job, but what I'm saying is,    14       Q.    No, I'm not going to tell you that right.   14   that's not a lot of tablets for a year.    15       A.    Do you know how many people are elderly?   15   Q.    Okay. The question � my question, sir,    16 Or do they say �   16   is you said that the question should have been asked    17       Q.    No, but I can Google it.   17   by the distributor and my question is actually pretty    18       A.    But do you understand what I'm saying?   18   simple. It is should those questions have been asked    19       Q.    Ida   19   by Mallinckrodt?    20       A.    There are a lot of reasons people would   20   MR. O'CONNOR: Objection.    21 take material. I'm not discounting the fact that   21   BY THE WITNESS:    22 maybe some of it was diverted by doctors or   22   A.    Based on the number, I don't think so.    23 unscrupulous people, but what I'm saying is, if you   23   BY MS. HERZFELD:    24 look at that for a whole year, we have a lot of people   24   Q.    Okay. And what about Strawberry Plains,    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 113 (446 - 449)     Case: k�7jmd/0�f&$S&n�>9�fr ^MfeEl^oOy^me^^d^^^^^^^^ew    Page 450      Page 452    i if we look here at East Tennessee Discount Drug, No.   l   constantly, Well, we have all of these old people.    2   12, it says Strawberry Plains had a 115,600 oxy   2   Well, one, the old people, do they not take 5s or 15s.    3  30 units-   3   Why does everybody take 30s, so.    4       A.    Okay.   4   Q.    To your knowledge �    5       Q.    � sent during that year to that pharmacy?   5   A.    Folks, that's a legitimate question.    6       A.    I'm sorry. How many.   6   Q.    Okay. And to your knowledge, those    7       Q.    115,600.   7   questions weren't asked of these pharmacies in    8       A.    Okay, I've got that.   8   Tennessee?    9       Q.

And they should say � and maybe they   7   EXAMINATION    8  should say, This is a rural area and there are only so   8   BY MR.

Okay. So you think that that's a   12   afternoon?    13  potential sign of diversion that should have been   13   A.    Yes.    14  looked into by the distributor?   14   Q.    Okay.

They are the ones that are supposed to do   17   a section of the document beginning with ""within that    i8  the on-site visits. They should know if it's a town   18   session""?    19  of 4,000. They should be able to tell us when we   19   A.    Yes.    20  inquire, you know, how � you know, how big a town it   20   Q.    And I believe you testified that you    21  is or what, you know, what their � their aging   21   understood the sentences that follow to be related to    22  population is or things like that. I don't know that   22   the ""know your customer's customer"" concept, is that    23  we've asked that. We did that in Florida now, asking   23   fair?    24  what the aging population is, because the excuse was   24   A.    Yes. Fair.

I don't recall that, but it � it's not   9   whether Howard Davis had expertise that was useful to    io  part of the statute.

Thank you.    3  customer's customer before July 21st, 2010?   3   A.    He didn't have, in my opinion, any    4       MR. KAWAMOTO: Objection.   4   knowledge about this � the program or as it was    5  BY THE WITNESS:   5   evolving. Now, he had retired, so I don't know that    6       A.

Should we put these back in order?   16   (WHEREUPON, a recess was had    17       Q.    Don't worry about it.   17   from 8:21 to 8:23 p.m.)    18       A.

On another note, I was able to talk to them about that 3rd party logistics program and they are gathering information on it as we speak. I'll send it to you once they send it to me. Sorry I have had so many requests on this but they are rolling and I don't want to lose the momentum with them.    Thanks again for everything.

They have also been expanding their reach to more and more customers who have been putting KMI into their formularies as a Secondary slot supplier and sometimes even as a Primary supplier.    KMI also has an all or nothing policy with their vendors in that they do not use a secondary supplier on any drugs. Fortunately, on all of our products at this account, we are their sole supplier. The good thing is that we garner 100% of their business and the bad thing is that there is no room for error.    I have attached the 1st 6 months sales history for us @ KMI. These results are driven directly from the things I mentioned above. Please understand that the March 2010 volume is only 3 weeks sales so we should see another $100,000.00 gain in march vs. Feb.

That would mean that the customer is ordering a product more often in recent weeks than their historical order pattern. This occurred with a order from Keysource in Cincinnati. They have placed 5 orders in March for code 324901 which is hydromorphone 8mg tabs. Before that they had 1 order in February, 2 in January, 2 in December. Do you know why they have increased their volume so much in March?

This will eliminate any need for CS to guess which product is being ordered. Please let them know and they can call me if further explanation is needed.    The 222 forms total $195,000. I have put the latest and largest order on hold (it is also waiting to be allocated) till I hear from you. Were you expecting Sunrise to place such a large order??

Below is list of pharmacies mentioned in your attachment # 1 with the dates that ""Our SOMS SYSTEM"" has identified as pharmacies needing to be cut off and reported to the DEA. As you can see the dates of termination pre-date your notification. These names have    been sent to the DEA, as per our MOA, by the 15   of the following month advising them of our account closure.    These accounts were identified by our SOMS using the many parameters built into the system including, but not limited to, size, frequency and pattern. In addition our compliance department checks the primary physicians and their zip codes as a way of spotting diversionary patterns. After all why would a pharmacy in Tennessee fill a prescription written in an Atlanta pain clinic for Oxycodone 30mg. Other checks include the percentage of prescriptions filled for patients written by pain clinics, either locat or especially out of town. There are a host of additional checks we use and information we gather in order to comply fully with the CFR, as I am sure you do.    In your last two letters to Masters you have judged our SOMS to be Inadequately robust. Yet somehow we identified these accounts well before you! Therefore, in the spirit of cooperation, I am preparing to send you a complete listing of all the accounts that we have closed and reported to the DEA in the hope that by sharing information we both can be more effective.

But in the example I shared   2   MR. TSAI: Object to the form.    3 with you a moment ago, I don't see anything wrong   3   THE WITNESS: I don't believe so.    4 with that from a DEA-registered organization to   4   BY MR.

So if there's   8   marketplace, if there's out-of-stocks issues in    9 out-of-stocks and Mallinckrodt has an opportunity,   9   the marketplace by my competitors, there's so many    i� I might.

Right.   19   Q    Well, describe diversion as best you    28 Patient preference is another.   20   can.    21        Q    So you, the director of sales at   21   A    If a track � I think when I was at    22 Mallinckrodt, takes into account patient   22   Mallinckrodt, a track of Watson, a competitor,    23 preference when making a decision to send   23   product was stolen. I think that's a form of    24 narcotics to a pharmacy?   24   diversion.    Page 79      Page 81    1             MR. TSAI: Object to the form.   1   I think if a pharmacy is robbed and they    2             THE WITNESS: I think you put words in   2   take medicine, I think that's going to be � I    3 my mouth there. If a patient only likes atenolol   3   think it's a form of either abuse or diversion.    4 with a blue color to it, they want that atenolol   4   I � so if a FedEx � Federal Express    5 with a blue color oval shape � I mean we're going   5   site is robbed, I think that could be a form of    8 down a road here that I'm not sure what you're   6   diversion. So...    7  asking, so I'm sharing you about a registered   7   Q    If a dispensing physician prescribes    8 organization to a registered pharmacy. And then I   8   opioids for reasons other medical necessity, is    9 think you're asking it another way, but I'm just   9   that diversion?    i�  sharing my thoughts.

If there's a prescription, we   2   Mallinckrodt, did you receive any trainings on    3 manufacture product, ship it to a wholesaler, who   3   what constitutes diversion?    4 then ships it to a pharmacy, an independent   4   A    I don't remember.    5 pharmacy, a chain pharmacy, whatever. Then it is   5   Q    Is it possible for a distributor that    8 dispensed to a patient, who comes in with a   6   you supplied pills to to engage in diversion?    7 prescription written by a doctor.   7   A    Do you mean ship to a location without a    8             There's a lot of steps here.

But that's just how I   14   And I think that's a part of the epidemic. So,    is think.   15   I'm sorry, I just wanted to share.    16  BY MR. LOESER:   16   Q    Okay. But when you were selling    17        Q   Would you agree that diversion   17   opioids, prescription opioids, OxyContin, for    is contributes to drug abuse and addiction?   18   example, did you know there was an opioid epidemic    19             MR.

Page 91      Page 93    1             MR. TSAI: Object to the form.   1   Q    Okay. So prior to what year?    2             Go ahead.   2   A    I started with Mallinckrodt in 2005.    3             THE WITNESS: It could be.   3   Q    So when you started you already knew    4 BY MR. LOESER:   4   there was on opioid epidemic in this country?    5        Q    Could be or it is?   5   A    I believe so.    8             MR.

Describe that.   l   Q    Mr. Borelli, you knew how much Oxy 15    2        A    I think from things you read, from   2   and 30 your clients were buying, correct?    3 things you hear, from things you listen to,   3   A    For the most part, yes.    4 understanding the DEA quotas assigned to scheduled   4   Q    And you knew they were buying a lot,    5 narcotic companies, how much quota is allocated.   5   correct?    8 I mean there's a lot of different things that come   6   A    ""A lot"" is a relative term. A lot to    7 into that.   7   what? For history or the United States needs?    8        Q    Okay. And you took those things into   8   Q    How about relative to what they were    9 account how?   9   buying before, the amount they were buying was    18        A    Just as an understanding of how the � I   10   increasing significantly, correct?    11 don't know if it's the � the process for the   11   MR. TSAI: Object to the form.    12 closed system, but all part of it.   12   THE WITNESS: Again, you would have to    13        Q    Okay. Did you evaluate whether   13   show me by molecule, by sales. You showed me a    14 particular types of pills manufactured by   14   broad brush number in dollars, and you didn't talk    15 Mallinckrodt were prone to abuse or diversion?   15   about the margin side. But in dollars, there were    18        A    Did I evaluate? I don't believe so.   16   customers that were up and there were customers    17        Q    And when you were selling opioid   17   that were down. But I don't know the molecules    18 products for Mallinckrodt, were you aware that   18   that were up, I don't know the molecules that were    19 oxy 15 and 30 milligram tablets were the most   19   down.    28 widely abused and diverted prescription opioids?   20   BY MR.

I   23   clients. Is that what you're saying?    24 did not know that.   24   A   Well, you showed sales dollars that went    Page 95      Page 97    i BY MR. LOESER:   1   up. Was it specific and only to Oxy 15 and 30? I    2        Q    That's news to you?   2   don't believe so.    3        A    I said I didn't know � I did not know   3   Q    Again, and we'll get into more specific    4 that that is the most widely abused.   4   documents, but as you sit here today, there aren't    5        Q    Did you know that your distributor   5   any trends with Oxy 15 and 30 in the time period    8 clients purchased enormous quantities of Oxy 15   6   where your bonuses were very large that you    7 and 30?   7   recall.    8        A    You know, they're servicing the whole   8   MR. TSAI: Object to the form.    9 country, and there's not a warehouse full of   9   THE WITNESS: ""Trends"" meaning sales    18 product that we just make � that they can fill   10   were increasing?    11 and sell. There's a finite amount of product   11   BY MR. LOESER:    12 that's assigned to us and our 25 competitors.   12   Q    Correct.    13        Q    I'm going to ask my question again and   13   A    Sales were increasing.    14 see if I understand your answer.   14   Q    And you were aware of that.    15             Did you know that your distributor   15   A    That sales were increasing? For my    18 clients purchased enormous quantities of Oxy 15   16   territory? Okay. I guess so.    17 and 30, yes or no?   17   I'd like to chime in for a second, if I    78             MR. TSAI: Object to the form.   18   could. If sales increase here, the sales will    19             THE WITNESS: It's not a ""yes"" or ""no""   19   decrease here because there's just a finite amount    28 answer. I think I shared just now that they   20   of product. So if Cardinal's sales are    21 service 50 states and Puerto Rico. I don't know   21   increasing, McKesson's sales may be decreasing    22 how much Cardinal needs every day, every week,   22   from Mallinckrodt. They buy from 25 � I'm not    23 every month.   23   even sure how many other vendors they purchase    24 BY MR. LOESER:   24   from. So I don't know if sales are increasing on    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 25 (94 - 97)     Case: i\^Tn$-^4$^&Q&#^^Q&te$0 0?<M^]27(<^�dJ^�'ftft^S^ew    Page 98   Page 100    i a grand 50-state scale. I don't know.   1 distributor customer sells to its downstream    2        Q    But you do know whether they were   2 customer at a price lower than the price that that    3 increasing in certain areas, right?   3 distributor purchased from Mallinckrodt,    4             MR. TSAI: Object to the form.   4 Mallinckrodt would make up the difference with a    5 BY MR. LOESER:   5 chargeback?    8        Q    It's not news to you that the sale of   8        A    I believe the � again, there is a    7 Oxy in Florida was increasing significantly during   7 department for chargebacks at Mallinckrodt. So I    8 the time that you were selling Oxy to your   8 believe that the chargeback was in place to get to    9 distributor clients, right?   9 a contract price.    i�        A    Was it increase � I don't know if it's   18        Q    Right. The contract price is the price    ii �I don't know if it's increasing in quantity   11  at which the drag was purchased from Mallinckrodt?    12 year to year. If our sales are up, then someone   12        A    I'm sorry?    13 else's sales are down, because it's allocated by   13        Q    Tell me what you mean by ""contract    i4 the DEA. And conversely, if Watson's sales are   14 price.""    15 going up, somebody else's sales will be going   15        A    An agreed-upon price that the    18 down. And it could be based on quota, could be   18 customer � I'm sorry � that the wholesaler would    17 based on supply. There's a lot � a lot of things   17 pay for any molecule.    18 that go into that.   18        Q    Okay. And so if the customer    19        Q    Mr. Borelli, you understand that over   19 distributor sold to a downstream customer at a    28 time, during the time where the opioid epidemic   28 price lower than the contract price, Mallinckrodt    21 was ongoing, which you said you knew about,   21 would then pay a chargeback to the distributor to    22 overall the amount of opioids being sold in this   22 get the distributor to the contract price; is that    23 country increased year over year, right?   23 right?    24             MR. TSAI: Object to the form.   24        A    I believe so, but you're better off �    Page 99   Page 101    1 BY MR. LOESER:   1 there's a chargeback team in place, so you're    2        Q    That's not news to you.   2 probably better off talking to the folks who    3        A    I knew about the epidemic. I shared   3 managed and worked in that department. But I    4 that with you. I don't know overall sales for   4 believe so.    5 that item in the country. And I don't know if   5        Q    That's your understanding.    8 Mallinckrodt's sales were higher year over year.   8        A    It's my understanding.    7 Because, again, if I pick up sales, someone may   7        Q    And was there competition among    8 have a decline.   8 manufacturers over the amount of the chargeback    9        Q    Can you explain to me what a chargeback   9 payments that were being paid to wholesalers?    i8 is?   18        A    I can't � I can't speak to how other    11        A    There was a specific chargeback   11 companies went to market.    12 organization that Mallinckrodt � it's a practice   12        Q    And would you agree that the chargeback    13 used to � in the pharmaceutical industry to get   13 payment to a distributor provides that distributor    14 to a contract price.   14 with an incentive to sell Mallinckrodt's products    15        Q    Let me try and understand. Chargeback   15 to its downstream customers?    18 payments are made by Mallinckrodt to distributor   18        A    I don't believe if s an incentive to    17 clients, correct?   17 sell. It's not incentive. It's to get them to a    18        A    That's correct.   18 contract price that they can then sell it to a    19        Q    And why does Mallinckrodt pay   19 cust� one of their pharmacies or hospitals,    28 distributor clients chargebacks?   28 yeah.    21        A    Well, they only would allocate a   21        Q    So that contract price becomes kind of a    22 chargeback payment when the wholesaler sells it to   22 guarantee when the chargeback is taken into    23  a pharmacy or a hospital.   23 account, right?    24        Q    And isn't the idea if the Mallinckrodt   24        A    Yes, I don't know if � I've never used    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 26 (98 - 101)     Case: ^^-Qmt^m^t^m.#^W^h<^^b ^(M^^^JrW-SdJ^m^b^^v^ew    Page 102      Page 104    i that word with chargebacks, so I think it's best   1   transcript question. Madam Reporter, is � I    2 to speak to the folks in the chargeback group or   2   think it might be � if you could read back at    3 department.   3   81 � the question by counsel starting at 81-21.    4        Q    And distributor � wholesale distributor   4   THE REPORTER: I think ours are    5 clients are more likely to purchase product from   5   different.    8 Mallinckrodt if they know that if they sell that   6   MR. LOESER: Do you want to go off the    7 product below the contract price, Mallinckrodt   7   record?    8 will make them whole, right?   8   MR. TSAI: Yeah.    9             MR. TSAI: Object to the form.   9   THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 11:00    i8             THE WITNESS: I'm not following you,   10   a.m. We're going off the record.    ii because why � I don't know how they would sell it   11   (Pause in the proceedings.)    12 below, because � they would buy it from us, and   12   THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is    13 they sold it to a customer, pharmacy. If they   13   11:01 a.m., and we're back on the record.    i4 sold it below the contract price, then they would   14   BY MR. LOESER:    15 be losing money.   15   Q    So when would a distributor receive a    i8 BY MR. LOESER:   16   chargeback payment? What would be the    17        Q    And then they would get a chargeback,   17   circumstances that would require that?    is right?   18   A    I would believe when one of their    19        A    The chargeback gets into the contract.   19   customers buys it, when they ship it to one of    28 So if it was $100 wholesale acquisition cost, and   20   their customers.    21 the contract was at 50, there's a $50 chargeback.   21   Q    So it's your understanding �    22 If they sold it at 40, they would go out of   22   A    One of their pharmacies that they    23 business, I believe, soon.   23   service � one of the stores that they service,    24             MR. TSAI: I'm sorry, the-   24   yeah.    Page 103      Page 105    1             THE WITNESS: I don't know the   1   Q    Okay. So the chargeback, it's not paid    2 specifics.   2   at the moment that the distributor purchases the    3             MR. TSAI: The realtime is lagging.   3   product from Mallinckrodt, right?    4 It's back up to � it's caught up. Thanks.   4   A    You'd have to talk to the chargeback    5             THE WITNESS: And those are just - I'm   5   department. I think there's a � there's a lag in    8 just sharing easy numbers. I �   6   time from when the chargeback comes back to the    7 BY MR. LOESER:   7   wholesaler from when they shipped it to one of    8        Q    Right. Again, I want to make sure I   8   their pharmacies.

All of this information is   1   terminology before?    2 information that you know is maintained in the   2   A    I've heard the term � terminology. I    3 chargeback system, right?   3   don't know if I've heard it at Mallinckrodt, but    4        A    I believe so.   4   I've heard the terminology before.    5        Q    So, Mr. Borelli, earlier you answered a   5   Q    And is that your understanding of    8 question of mine about what Mallinckrodt could see   6   customers of customers are � are the downstream    7  after it sold its pills to the distributors that   7   customers of your customers?    8 were its clients, and I asked you � so you're   8   A    I believe so.    9 saying you had no visibility after you sold pills   9   Q    And again, Mallinckrodt in this    18 to the distributor, that's where your visibility   10   chargeback system had detailed information about    11  stopped on what happened to those pills. And you   11   the shipment of Mallinckrodt products between its    12  answered yeah.   12   distributor clients and all of its downstream    13             Okay. And let me ask you again based on   13   customers, right?    14 what we went through, and maybe I'll ask it in a   14   MR. TSAI: Object to the form.    15 way that makes more sense to you. It's certainly   15   THE WITNESS: I don't - I can't speak    18 the case that Mallinckrodt knew exactly where its   16   to all of our � I didn't manage all of our    17 pills were sent by its distributor clients,   17   customers, and I don't know the system. So...    18 correct?   18   BY MR. LOESER:    19             MR. TSAI: Object to the form.   19   Q    But that's your understanding, that you    28             THE WITNESS: I believe so.   20   were tracking the downstream customers of your    27 BY MR. LOESER:   21   distributors.    22        Q    If s clear that Mallinckrodt in this   22   MR. TSAI: Object to the form.    23 chargeback system data knew for every transaction   23   THE WITNESS: I was not. If you're    24 by a distributor client who the downstream   24   asking if Mallinckrodt was, I � I'm going to    Page 131      Page 133    1 customer was for that transaction, right?   1   assume yes, but I � you know, I wasn't in this    2             MR.

LOESER:    4        Q    You can answer.   4   Q    And pharmacies are also downstream    5        A    I believe so.   5   customers of your distributor clients.    8        Q    And there's nothing terribly unique   6   A    I believe so.    7 about sorting on Dr. Schultz. Mallinckrodt could   7   Q    And would you agree that it would not be    8 also sort on any other downstream customer,   8   accurate to say that Mallinckrodt lacked detailed    9 including pharmacies, right?   9   information about the shipment of its products    io             MR. TSAI: Object to the form.   10   between its distributor clients and pharmacies?    ii             THE WITNESS: I don't - I'm going to   11   MR. TSAI: Object to the form.    12 assume yes, but again, I'm not familiar with this   12   THE WITNESS: I don't know the accuracy.    13 system or the � or the sorting process.   13   I mean, from � and I think it's best to ask a    14 BY MR. LOESER:   14   chargeback person that question to � to know the    15        Q    But so when it says the field ""Ship to   15   accuracy for the company.    16 customer name,"" those are the customers of the   16   BY MR.

Have you heard that   24   to � you know, I think you're talking about �    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 34 (130 - 133)     Case: ^^-Qmt^m^t^m.#^W^h<^^b ^(M^^^JrW-SdJ^m^b^^^iew    Page 134      Page 136    1 you're telling me the chargeback systems, and I'm   1   MR. TSAI: Object to the form.    2 not comfortable with that.   2   THE WITNESS: I believe so.    3        Q    Right, that's a fair point. I'd like to   3   BY MR. LOESER:    4 know what � just what you know.   4   Q    And you could determine whether a    5             So you think �   5   downstream customer was ordering an excessive    8        A    Yeah.   6   number of pills from the chargeback system because    7        Q    You would agree based on what you've   7   you could see exactly how many pills that    8 seen that it would not be accurate to say that   8   downstream customer was ordering from your    9 Mallinckrodt lacked detailed information about its   9   distributor customer, right?    18 distributor sales to its downstream customers who   10   MR. TSAI: Object to the form.    11 were pharmacies.   11   THE WITNESS: I'm not quite familiar    12        A    I believe so.   12   with � I'm not sure � when you say ""excessive,""    13             MR. TSAI: Object to the form.   13   I don't know what that means.    14             Go ahead.   14   BY MR. LOESER:    is             THE WITNESS: I believe so.   15   Q    Okay. You could see the amount of pills    i8 BY MR. LOESER:   16   that any downstream customer ordered from any    17        Q    Your answer was ""I believe so""?   17   distributor.    18        A    Yes. But I wasn't in that department,   18   MR. TSAI: Object to the form.    19 so I'm assuming here.   19   THE WITNESS: I believe so.    28        Q    Okay. You weren't in that department,   20   BY MR. LOESER:    21 but again, we've gone through these fields and you   21   Q    And so Mallinckrodt could assess from    22 see that � that there's a customer name, and the   22   that data in however it chose to do so whether    23 customer name is the customer of the distributor,   23   that order was excessive or not, right?    24 and that can be a pharmacy or that can be a pain   24   A    I believe so.    Page 135      Page 137    1 clinic, right? Or that can be a dispensing   1   Q    And you could see from the chargeback    2 physician, right?   2   data whether a downstream customer ordered from a    3        A    Or hospital. Yes.   3   variety of Mallinckrodt distributor clients,    4        Q    Okay. It's not your understanding that   4   right?    5 the chargeback system does not also track sales by   5   A    You're speaking about chargebacks    8 your distributors to pharmacies?   6   data � chargeback data that I'm � I'm just not    7        A    Say that again.   7   familiar with chargeback data specifically.    8             MR. LOESER: Could you repeat the   8   Q    So you -    9 question, please.   9   A    There's a team in place � there was a    i�             (Whereupon, the requested record   10   team in place at Mallinckrodt that � that was    11             was read.)   11   specifically responsible for chargeback data. So    12 BY MR. LOESER:   12   that's available, but �    13        Q    Put it more simply, the chargeback   13   Q    Okay.    14  system also tracks sales by distributors to   14   (Borelli Exhibit No. 11 was marked    15 pharmacies.   15   for identification.)    16        A    Thanks. I believe so.   16   MR. TSAI: Thank you.    17        Q    And from the chargeback data,   17   BY MR. LOESER:    18 Mallinckrodt could determine whether a distributor   18   Q    I'm showing you what's been marked    19 client ordered a limited variety of controlled   19   Exhibit 11. This is another printout that we did    28  substances, such as oxy 15s and 30s, while   20   from the chargeback system data produced by    21 ordering few, if any, other types of drags, right?   21   Mallinckrodt.    22  So you could see if the � if the downstream   22   And you'll see that this exhibit sorts    23 customer was only ordering oxy and was not   23   on the customer Harvard Drag. Do you see that?    24 ordering anything else from Mallinckrodt.   24   A    I do.

So I don't know if I had Harvard    8             MR. TSAI: Same standing objection as   8   at that time. I'm not quite sure, but �    9 before to this Exhibit 11.   9   Q    And whether you had that client or not,    io             THE WITNESS: I see his name in a   10   this is information that resided in Mallinckrodt's    11 column, but I don't see anything else. I see his   11   chargeback data, right?    12 name and I see an address.   12   A    Oh, okay. Okay.    13 BY MR. LOESER:   13   Q    And so Barry Schultz, as we saw in an    i4        Q    Okay. So you see his name, ship to   14   earlier exhibit, was purchasing from Sunrise, and    15 customer name, Barry Schultz, and if you go back   15   Barry Schultz is an MD, right? That's what the    16 to the left, you can see ""Sold via child customer   16   chargeback system said.    17 name, and it says ""Harvard Drug.""

TSAI: Thank you.   22   A    That's what it says here.    23             THE WITNESS: What was the question?   23   Q    So if you had seen this data when you    24 BY MR. LOESER:   24   still worked at Mallinckrodt, would you have    Page 139      Page 141    1        Q    You see the second column is customer   1   thought it unusual and perhaps suspicious that a    2 name and it says Harvard Drug, right?   2   medical doctor was receiving oxy 15 and 30 from a    3        A    I see that.   3   company doing business as First Veterinary Supply?    4        Q    But then you also see the next column   4   MR. TSAI: Object to the form.    5 over, it says ""dba,"" that's doing business as,   5   BY MR. LOESER:    8 right, ""First Veterinary Supply.""

They don't �    28 door?""   20   they don't tell any of them how to act or how to    21             Why did you identify that as a question   21   not act. They just don't.    22 that could provide information on whether a   22   Q    So you're saying to your distributor    23 non-addiction treatment is a dangerous category to   23   customer who is buying substantial quantities of    24  sell to?   24   oxycodone for you, I don't really have any idea    Page 287      Page 289    1        A    That was what the DEA agent had talked   1   how you tell if something is a dangerous category    2 about things to look for, Louis Fisher.   2   to sell to.

I don't remember   5   A    No, I think the tone you just used is    8 specifically.   6   improper. You're kind of being cavalier about    7        Q    Okay.

Smith either.    7 noted the following.   7   Q    Can you speak to that reason? Do you    8             Do you see that?   8   understand why the ratio of controlled substances    9        A    I do, but I doubt that that is Steve   9   to nonscheduled products would be a reason to    i� Cochrane.   10   restrict or shut down a sale to a downstream    ii        Q    Who do you think it is?   11   customer?    12        A    I doubt a customer would talk to another   12   A    I said I don't know H.D.

Somebody that -   14   that has, I'm not sure, how many SKUs � 13,000    is        A    But I don't know if it - I'm not   15   SKUs. So they have every item that is    i8 exactly sure who that Steve is, but it � you   16   manufactured. So they're looking at so many    17 know, it could be Steve Becker, who managed that   17   different items, so I �    18  account at that time. I don't know.   18   Q    So you don't know, sir, why this    19        Q    So, nonetheless, Steve asked H.D. Smith   19   information would be relevant to determining    28 how they identified accounts they had shut down   20   whether to shut off or restrict a customer.    21  and restricted, and he got a list from H.D. Smith.   21   That's my only question to you. Do you    22             And do you see the list on that e-mail?   22   understand why this ratio would be a relevant    23        A    I do.   23   consideration when deciding to suspend or    24        Q    Do you know who C-I � C, I think Roman   24   eliminate a customer?

If lisinopril is   7   you know why that would be an item to look at when    8 an item that they sell more of than something   8   deciding whether to shut down or severely restrict    9 else, will they stop shipping lisinopril? I don't   9   a customer?    i� know.   10   A    I do not.    ii        Q    Mr. Borelli, did you pay any attention   11   Q    And the last item on the list for    i2 to the ratio of controlled substances your   12   reasons why H.D.

Do you know what that means?    is        A    Yeah, I did.   15   A    I do not.    18        Q    Why?   16   Q    So you don't know what any of these    17        A    I tried to look at all of my items that   17   things mean, and yet you forwarded this    18 I market � that I sell.   18   information to Mr. Cochrane and you wrote: ""Let's    19        Q    Is that an indication of potential   19   talk about this when you get back from your mini    28 diversion when a customer is buying only   20   vacation.

That's what happened    19 if the pharmacy was closed door, servicing just   19   here, there was a transition.    28 physicians, do you know why that would be   20   A    Did � did we sell to H.D.

Was there a    23        A    Yeah, I do not.   23   supply shortage, was there a DEA quota shortage?    24        Q    And if you look at the next item, large   24   I don't know any of these things.

My name is Tricia Herzfeld, and    8 of the risks of oxy?   8   I'm an attorney from Tennessee who's representing    9        A    The risks of oxy. If it's prescribed   9   the Tennessee plaintiffs in the Staubus and    18 properly and used properly, there's not a risk.   10   Dunaway matters.    11        Q    And do you know if oxy is addictive?   11   MS. HERZFELD: I'd like to start out the    12        A    I believe it could be if it's used   12   deposition by lodging an objection to some pretty    13 improperly. I believe it could be.   13   rank violations of the Court's order for the    14        Q    And your understanding is based on   14   production of documents in anticipation of this    15 training you received at Mallinckrodt?   15   document. According to the Court's order for the    18        A    I'm not sure if it's training that I   16   MDL case, which we are not a party to, we were    17 received at Mallinckrodt.   17   cross-noticed in this case, Mallinckrodt was to    18        Q    Did you receive any training at   18   produce Mr. Borelli, his complete and custodial    19 Mallinckrodt on the risks of oxycodone?   19   file by November the 15th.    28        A    I don't remember all the training, so   20   On November the 23rd of this year, six    21 I'm not sure.   21   days before his deposition, Mallinckrodt produced    22        Q    Mr. Borelli, did anyone at Mallinckrodt   22   to the Tennessee plaintiffs over 2,000 documents,    23 sell more oxycodone than you during the time   23   sent to or from Mr. Borelli.    24 period that you worked there?   24   On the evening of November 27th, less    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 94 (370 - 373)     Case: ^lo;^                                               9?/M*fe�^rH�dePi^mft^�^e    Page 374   1   than 48 hours before his deposition, Mallinckrodt   2   again produced courtesy copies of MDL files that   3   contained Borelli custodial files and his   4   personnel file.   5               Additionally, Mallinckrodt was required   8 to inform my clients whether Mr. Borelli had any   7   personal knowledge related to my clients'   8   lawsuits. Instead, Mallinckrodt simply stated   9   that Borelli had no Tennessee-specific knowledge. 18             We believe that this prejudices us in   11   our ability to go forward in the deposition today.   12   We reserve all rights to depose Mr. Borelli in the   13   future if we deem it to be necessary, and   14   specifically, if additional documents are   15   produced.   18             My understanding is Mallinckrodt has not   17   made a full production in this Staubus or Dunaway   18   case pursuant to pending discovery requests, so   19   Tennessee-specific information has not yet been 28 provided.   21               With that being said, I would like to go   22   forward, please.   23               I'm sure you have something to say.   24               MR.

And do you know what he's   18   Earlier when we were talking about    19 referring to, the legitimate business in Florida?   19   Dr. Barry Schultz, you said you � I'm    28        A    This is his e-mail to me.   20   paraphrasing here, but you didn't � didn't recall    21        Q    Yes, sir.   21   him.    22        A    So yeah, I know � I'm just saying this   22   A    He did not come to mind, yes.    23 is his e-mail to me, so I can't speak for Steve   23   MS.

Page 439      Page 441    1 what he means by those sentences.   1   (Borelli Exhibit No. 56 was marked    2        Q    So you're talking about the Florida   2   for identification.)    3 oxycodone business when you e-mail him, right?   3   BY MS. HERZFELD:    4        A    I am.   4   Q    You'll read it from the bottom up.    5        Q    Okay. And then he responds that he   5   A    (Peruses document.) Okay.    8 could take advantage of some of the, quote,   6   Q    Okay. You've had a chance to review it?    7 legitimate business that does exist in Florida.   7   A    Yes.    8        A    When I'm talking about the Florida   8   Q    Okay. And now that you had a chance to    9 business, I'm � really the guts of this � really   9   review it, does that refresh your recollection at    i� the only part of this e-mail is to refer him to a   10   all about being involved at all with investigating    11 consultant that was a DEA agent, Louis Fisher,   11   Sunrise and dealing with Barry Schultz?    12 over 30 years. So � he is also a registered   12   A    I � I was not part � I was in the    13 pharmacist. I forgot that. So that's what I �   13   meeting of the audit.    14 that's what I'm sending this to him for is to   14   Q    Okay.    15 perhaps use a professional � use a person who   15   A    And it looks like Barry Schultz was one    18 vets out � vets customers for wholesalers.   16   of five random audits � random accounts that was    17        Q    Okay.

I'm not sure.    19  ""legitimate"" right? The legitimate businesses.   19   It looks like one of five, yeah.    28        A    That's what he typed.   20   Q    Okay. And so you sent this initial    21        Q    So that would imply there's legitimate   21   e-mail, right? It's from you, Victor Borelli, to    22 and illegitimate oxycodone business in Florida.   22   Karen Harper, copying John Adams, on August 18th,    23 Isn't that right?   23   2009, at 9:57 p.m.; is that correct?    24        A    Not that I know of.

And it says ""five targeted   17   don't remember what it was.    18 customers,"" not five random customers; is that   18   Q    Okay. Okay. And then No. 57. Oops,    19 right?   19   let me give you the right one.    28        A    Yes. But I don't know how those   20   (Borelli Exhibit No. 57 was marked    21 customers � I don't remember how those customers   21   for identification.)    22 were culled out.   22   THE WITNESS: Thank you.    23        Q    Okay.

If you'll look at the bottom and    Page 443      Page 445    i        A    Yes.   1   work your way up, it looks like an e-mail from you    2        Q    And you said there was a review of the   2   to Jim Rausch and Karen Harper dated June 9th,    3 formal questionnaire filled out by Louis Fisher as   3   2011, at 8:34 p.m.    4 well as the recent 222 forms with the orders   4   Did I read that correctly?    5 attached. 4.

And so you did have � you did   13   A    Yes.    14 review the ordering habits of Dr. Barry Schultz in   14   Q    And the topic here is ""KeySource    15 2009, and continued � and as well as other   15   Medical""; is that right?    18 Sunrise targeted customers, and continued to ship   16   A    Yes.    17 to Sunrise after these audit findings; is that   17   Q    Okay.

And do you see that line that    i2 October 2007 through February of 2011 ?   12   goes through for Tennessee being on the chart?    13        A    It doesn't look familiar, but � it   13   It's a little hard to see.    14 looks � it's hard �   14   A    It's hard to see, so I'm not quite sure    is        Q    Is that what the chart says?   15   which one Tennessee is, but there's a legend on    18        A    It's hard to tell, but, yeah, I believe   16   the right.    17  so.   17   Q    Mm-hmm.

I also brought Brian into the loop to ensure that we were analyzing the segmentation correctly.    The official  ""Addition Treatment Clinics"" segmentation is only 2.6% of the 40MG sales I outlined below. As Brian pointed out, the number is likely higher as some of the ""Hospitals"" segmentation could include dispensing for AT.    However, Chain, Independent, and Food account for 90% of sales.    And when I add in other segmentation likely not dispensing for AT (mail, LTC, etc.) I get close to 95% of sales.    so likely the correct number is 3-5%.

Yeah, it would be through chargebacks. The issue is that the contract numbers and buying groups would not give you the answer, but the end customer on the chargeback would in theory be segmented as a clinic or otherwise. So I'll try to pull these sales by customer segmentation, and assuming this is correct, should give us the answer. I'll email back when I have an answer.

This is perfect. Can u also find out of the 40mg sales into the channel how much of it ends up in clinics (who source from the wholesaler)?    ----- Original Message-----    From: Burd, Jeff W  MKG To: Kaiman, Vince J Sent: Tue Apr 17 14:02:07 2007 Subject: Methadone    Vince,    I have a spreadsheet with backup if you want, but in case you can't open I'll briefly summarize here.    It is definitely more profitable to move from the 40MG to either the 5MG or the 10MG. But it is much more profitable to move to the 10MG. The major reason behind this is that we actually have a better cost position on the 10MG than the 5MG ($1.36 for the 10MG vs. $1.85 for the 5MG), likely due to volume (10MG is over 5x the 5MG). So even though the ASP is higher (per MG) on the 5MG, overall the 10MG is a better move (it would also be less of a cost increase for customers).    I ran new numbers on the 40MG and for the last 12 months I show contract sales of approximately $8M, at a gross margin of $6M. Moving to the 5MG would result sales/margin of $12M/$6.5M, and moving to the 10MG would result in sales/margin of $9M/$7M.    Let me know (or call) if you have any more questions or need more detail.

They were the ones    that asked who is ensuring when we get an order it is going to a licensed facility, so I appreciate the quick response    and will let Pat's group know.    I do have one more question - glad to see there are contingency plans, but since McKesson failed to fill out our SOM    questionnaire (choosing only to send us a blanket letter saying they have a Suspicious Order Monitoring program) can    we confirm somehow that Concerta, TWC, Ultram or Durogesic were not involved? Our questionnaire if they    completed it would have told us if our products were in their SOM program.

The nationwide settlement requires McKesson to suspend sales of controlled substances from distribution centers in Colorado, Ohio, Michigan and Florida for multiple years. The staged suspensions are among the most severe sanctions ever agreed to by a DEA-registered distributor. The settlement also imposes new and enhanced compliance obligations on McKesson's distribution system.    In 2008, McKesson agreed to a $13.25 million civil penalty and administrative agreement for similar violations. In this case, the government alleged again that McKesson failed to design and implement an effective system to detect and report ""suspicious orders"" for controlled substances distributed to its independent and small chain pharmacy customers- i.e. orders that are unusual in their frequency, size, or other patterns. From 2008 until 2013, McKesson supplied various U.S. pharmacies an increasing amount of oxycodone and hydrocodone pills, frequently misused products that are part of the current opioid epidemic.    The government's investigation developed evidence that even after designing a compliance program after the 2008 settlement, McKesson did not fully implement or adhere to its own program. In Colorado, for example, McKesson processed more than 1.6 million orders for controlled substances from June 2008 through May 2013, but reported just 16 orders as suspicious, all connected to one instance related to a recently terminated customer.    JAN-     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1960-102  Filed:  07/23/19 5 of 5.  PagelD #: 140179    ""This groundbreaking resolution is tough and appropriate and underscores our commitment to hold accountable all DEA registrants, including those who distribute controlled substances,"" said DEA Acting Administrator Chuck Rosenberg.  ""DEA is committed to fighting the opioid epidemic with all of the tools at our disposal.""    In addition to the monetary penalties and suspensions, the government and McKesson agreed to enhanced compliance terms for the next five years. Among other things, McKesson has agreed to specific, rigorous staffing and organizational improvements; periodic auditing; and stipulated financial penalties for failing to adhere to the compliance terms. Critically, the settlement will require McKesson to engage an independent monitor to assess compliance-the first independent monitor of its kind in a CSA civil penalty settlement.    This was a multi-district investigation that involved the following DEA Field Divisions: Boston Field Division, Chicago Field Division, Denver Field Division, Detroit Field Division, Miami Field Division, New Jersey Field Division, San Francisco Field Division, St. Louis Field Division, and Washington Division Office. The following U.S. Attorneys' Offices participated in the case: Central District of California, Eastern District of California, District of Colorado, Middle District of Florida, Eastern District of Kentucky, Northern District of Illinois, District of Massachusetts, Eastern District of Michigan, District of Nebraska, District of New Jersey, Northern District of West Virginia, and Western District of Wisconsin.    U.S. Attorneys' Offices for the District of Colorado and the Northern District of West Virginia, along with DEA's Office of Chief Counsel and its Diversion Control Division, led the civil settlement negotiations.  DEA's Denver, Detroit and Miami Field Divisions and its Washington Division Office led the administrative and civil investigation. The U.S. Department of Justice Criminal Division's Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Section (NDDS) also coordinated and assisted in negotiating certain portions of the settlement. Assistant United States Attorneys Amanda Rocque (Colorado) and Alan McGonigal (NDWV) represented the United States in the civil penalty investigations and negotiations. Associate Chief Counsel Lee Reeves and Senior Attorneys Dedra Curteman, Dana Hill and Krista Tongring represented DEA in the investigations and negotiations.

Washington, DC 20004    Dear Ms. Avergun:    I have attached for your information and review our initial findings and recommendations on Cardinal Healthcare's Suspicious Order Monitoring (SOM) System.    From our initial review, it does not appear that implementation of Cardinal's Phase I SOM system procedures will meet the regulatory requirements without additional realtime monitoring capabilities (though we understand Phase II is under development and will address a number of these issues). As you will note from the report, the Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) communication to registrants on December 27, 2007, will require that registrants develop more controls than are plainly visible from a reading of the regulations. Additionally, the DEA has offered no guidance in terms of the minimum acceptable system requirements. In light of these new developments, work will continue with Cardinal to develop a computer system that is compliant with defensible statistical procedures and to further develop rigorous procedural tests to ensure that the program does not rely on the computer system alone.    Please advise if you require additional information and/or further clarification.    Sincerely,    Ronald W. Buzzeo Chief Regulatory Officer    RWELadm    Attachment: Cardinal Healthcare's Suspicious Order Monitoring (SOM) System-Phase I    ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGED/CONI fill M f \L    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL    CAH MDL2804 03309960     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1964-7  Filed:  07/23/19 3 of 13.  PagelD #: 163446    Cardinal Healthcare's Suspicious Order Monitoring (SOM) System -    Phase I    Executive Summary:    From approximately December 6, 2007 through the present, Cegedim Dendrite staff, including Chief Regulatory Officer Ronald W. Buzzeo, R.Ph., have been working with Cardinal Healthcare's (Cardinal) executive management on numerous regulatory issues, including suspicious order monitoring (SOM), training, on-site interviews of staff and investigations related to new and existing customers.    Information pertaining to Cardinal's SOM system has been gathered during on site visits at Cardinal's headquarters and follow up conference calls and email correspondences with a number of Cardinal employees including Mr. Michael Mone, Vice President for Anti Diversion, Stephen J. Reardon, Vice President, Quality and Regulatory Assurance, and others. (Attachment 1 to this document is an email correspondence chain that includes a series of questions and answers between Mr. Mone and Mr. Buzzeo regarding the SOM system.) During the on site interview process, Mr. Reardon provided information to Cegedim Dendrite consultants Robert C. Williamson and William J. Reinig. Cegedim Dendrite IT Specialists Sharon Dennis, Scott Hardy, and Barbara Hess also made on site visits to evaluate the Phase I SOM system from an IT standpoint and to prepare for the execution of a validation exercise for Cardinal's SOM system.    According to Mr. Reardon, Cardinal's suspicious order monitoring system is modeled after the system designed by AmerisourceBergen (Amerisource) and this system relies upon groupings of drugs and groupings of customers. The average order quantity of each group of drugs is calculated on a monthly basis for each customer group. Orders that are three times the monthly average are blocked and investigated. According to Mr. Reardon, in the Amerisource system, Schedule III, IV and V controlled substances that are eight times the monthly average are blocked.    However, issues continue to emerge which will have to be resolved before the system will be in compliance with the regulations (21 CFR 1301.74(b)) and the Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA's) guidance, as reflected in the letters the DEA forwarded to the industry in September, 2006, February, 2007 and December, 2007.    Cegedim Dendrite staff reviewed the Phase I deployment of Cardinal's SOM program and the findings herein are limited to the Phase I system. (Phase II development and testing is in process.) Phase I includes only four controlled substances and is applicable to only certain customer accounts. An additional regulatory deficiency associated with the Phase I system is that an order that is ""blocked"" as being possibly suspicious is simply reduced to the threshold limit and filled. These and other deficiencies must be eliminated immediately and corrective measures should be included in Phase II when launched. Upon review and audit of the system followed by computer systems validation testing, a determination will be made if the methodologies are sufficient.    ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVTLEGED/CONI I III M I VI,    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL    CAH MDL2804 03309961     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1964-7  Filed:  07/23/19 4 of 13.  PagelD #: 163447    An additional concern with the Phase I system relates to the ability of the system to track deviations in individual ordering patterns. This requirement is specifically addressed in the regulation. This was brought to the attention of Mr. Reardon during an on site interview on December 21st and he indicated that Cardinal could discern this information from the ""ingredient limit report"" (and thus this requirement was not further incorporated in the SOM system). Cardinal's ""ingredient limit reports"" are based upon historical information and are not sufficient to monitor deviations in ordering patterns on a real time basis. We believe real time analysis is required.    A communication received by Cardinal and other DEA registrants dated December 27, 2007, has further complicated Cardinal's ability to implement a fully compliant suspicious order monitoring program. This communication has advised registrants that the DEA does not ""approve"" SOM systems and establishes additional concerns for registrants who are revising their suspicious order monitoring systems.    Additional findings and recommendations are contained in the report.    ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVTLEGED/CONI fill M f \l.    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL    CAH MDL2804 03309962     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1964-7  Filed:  07/23/19 5 of 13.  PagelD #: 163448    Findings and Recommendations:    1.        Cardinal's Phase I Suspicious Order Monitoring System is incomplete and    does not meet the regulatory requirements. (However, because Phase II is scheduled to be implemented by February 2008, it is clear that this interim system was intended to only be an initial first step at implementation.)    Mr. Reardon indicated that Cardinal was planning to launch the SOM system in two phases. In Phase I only four controlled substances would be included (hydrocodones, oxycodones, phentermine and alprazolam). According to Mr. Reardon, these were the drugs that had been highlighted during the DEA's investigation of the Houston distribution center. Cardinal intended to organize their controlled substances by the drug codes contained in the Code of Federal Regulations. Packaging sizes would be normalized to ""dosage units."" Only solid dosage units would be included in Phase I. Customers would be grouped into like groups; however, not all customer groupings would be evaluated in the initial phase.    The basic process is to establish monthly averages for each drug for each group. Our understanding from Mr. Reardon is that the monthly averages are established by Cardinal's QRA department. Customer orders that are in excess of three times the average (which would be the threshold) would be held for further investigation. Orders that were held would be reduced to the threshold and sent to the customer. Delayed orders would be investigated. If the order was cleared of suspicion, the remainder of the order would be furnished to the customer. If the order was not cleared of the suspicion, the order would not be filled above the threshold limit; however, no report would be made to the DEA. Cegedim Dendrite views average settings as a comparison tool, but not in itself sufficient to be in full compliance with the regulations.    Only independent retail pharmacies would be investigated during Phase I. Individual customer groupings were to be further subdivided into small, medium and large to eliminate the possibility that large pharmacies would be blocked only because they routinely order large amounts of drugs, including controlled substances. Customers would be classified as small, medium and large based the total dollar volume of prescription business during a measured period.    Recommendations    a.          Expand the system to include all controlled substances and List I chemicals.    b.         Expand the system to include all DEA registrants, such as pharmacies and other accounts, including government accounts, managed care, physicians, hospitals, manufacturers / repackagers, contract distributors, etc.    1 We understand from informal consultations that recommendations a, b, c, d, and e are already accepted and planned as a part of the Phase II SOM.    ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGED/CONI IDIMIII,    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL    CAH MDL2804 03309963     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1964-7 Filed: 07/23/19 6 of 13.  PagelD #: 163449    c.          Expand the system to include all dosage units.    d.         Review all orders in their entirety and in real time.    e.          Report all orders to the DEA that cannot be cleared of suspicion and cancel the entire order.    2.        Cardinal's Phase I Suspicious Order Monitoring System is not sufficient to    comply with the language in the Code of Federal Regulations.    21 CFR 1301.74(b) specifically states that suspicious orders include orders of an unusual size, orders deviating substantially from a normal pattern and orders of an unusual frequency. DEA's correspondence of December 27, 2007 indicates that, ""These criteria are disjunctive and are not all inclusive.""    Cardinal staff report that information regarding size and pattern can be gleaned from the ""ingredient limit reports"" that were previously submitted to the DEA on a monthly basis. However, it should be noted that these reports are historical. DEA's correspondence of December 27, 2007 states that ""... registrants must conduct an independent analysis of suspicious orders prior to completing a sale to determine whether the controlled substances are likely to be diverted from legitimate channels"" (emphasis added). This guidance is amplified in the same correspondence. The DEA states that ""registrants that routinely report suspicious orders, yet fill these orders without first determining that order is not being diverted into other than legitimate medical, scientific and industrial channels, may be failing to maintain effective controls against diversion."" Accordingly, an SOM system must be able to analyze, on a real time basis, pattern and frequency. Historical ""ingredient limit reports,"" while useful, do not substitute for real time automated analysis of pattern and frequency.    Recommendations    a.          Immediately commence development of a real time computer program that identifies orders of an unusual size, orders deviating substantially from a normal pattern, and orders of an unusual frequency, even if the order is below the established threshold and/or standard deviation.    b.         Review and block all orders in real time, perform an appropriate investigation, and report orders that cannot be cleared of suspicion to the DEA in a standard format by a single point of contact.    c.          The entire order that cannot be cleared from suspicion should be cancelled and reported to the DEA and the account should be examined.    d.         Ensure that thresholds and standard deviations/factors are only utilized as one part of an anti-diversion program    ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGED/CONI IDIMIII,    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL                                                                                                                          CAH MDL2804 03309964     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1964-7  Filed:  07/23/19 7 of 13.  PagelD #: 163450    3.        Cardinal's Phase I system may not meet statutory requirements.    It has been reported to us by Mr. Reardon, that Cardinal's system is based upon the Amerisource SOM system. In the fall of 2007, the DEA invited Amerisource to a DEA-sponsored industry conference (13th Pharmaceutical Conference, September 11 - 12, 2007, Houston, TX) to make a presentation regarding its SOM system. This resulted in the impression among Cardinal attendees and others that the Amerisource SOM system had the imprimatur of the DEA.    Mr. Reardon indicated that he attended this conference and that Michael Mapes, Chief, DEA, Regulatory Section, and Chris Zimmerman, Vice President, Corporate Security and Regulatory Affairs, Amerisource either indicated directly or implied that the Amerisource model could be considered a standard for SOM system development. Based on this impression, Mr. Reardon recommended the Cardinal SOM system be developed with functionality similar to the Amerisource methodology.    The Amerisource system apparently follows a methodology that was developed by the DEA's Suspicious Orders Task Force. This methodology is published on the DEA's web site.2 This, of course, cannot be confirmed since a review of Amerisource's system has not been conducted. However, the Amerisource system (and Cardinal's system in development) is quite similar to the guidance published on the DEA's web site, and Cegedim Dendrite agrees that Cardinal's Phase I system comports with several indicia discussed in DEA's Chemical Handler's Manual. It should be noted that the chemical handler's manual is slightly dated, having been published in January 2004.    Regardless of Cardinal's prior impressions, in its December 27, 2007 communication to DEA registrants, the DEA has now stated that ""past communications with DEA, whether implicit or explicit, that could be construed as approval of a particular system for reporting suspicious orders, should no longer be taken to mean that DEA approves a specific system.""    This means that Cardinal's SOM system will have to rely on internal logistical strengths and performance measurements.    Recommendations    a.          Subject all system methodologies to rigorous statistical analysis to assure that the system is statistically sound.    b.         Proceed with plans to utilize an independent third party (Cegedim Dendrite) to execute ""verification events"" (or audits) to assure that the SOM system adequately identifies suspicious orders and that the orders are reported to the DEA.    2 See deadiversion@usdoi.gov/publications/manuals/chemical handlers manual/appendices/Appendix E3    ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGED/CONI IDIMIII,    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL    CAH MDL2804 03309965     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1964-7  Filed:  07/23/19 8 of 13.

A review of additional records and interviews with additional representatives could result in additional issues and recommendations.    The foregoing recommendations represent our best professional judgment based on our knowledge of the DEA regulations and our experience with them.

Number of retail and chains in the threshold categories for each controlled substance i.e. utilizing oxy as an example    Currently, Phase 1 of Cardinal Health's SOM only applies to Retail Independent customers. Cardinal's SOM will include all additional customers, including Chain Pharmacies, once Phase 2 is implemented in the beginning of February 2008. To establish initial threshold categories, all Retail Independent customers were classified as Small, Medium, or Large based on total Rx sales. An analysis was conducted of the customers that have been classified and uploaded as part of the current SOM program. Overall, 1,741 customers were classified as Large, while 1,806 and 3,237 customers were classified as Medium and Small respectively.    Pre-established limits were applied for all Retail Independent customers based on their size classification for each of the four drugs included of Phase 1 of the SOM program. The limits for an individual customer can be raised or lowered after an assessment by the QRA department. The tables below outline the number of customers classified within each limit for each drug. It should be noted that all tables below are based on limits assigned on January 1, 2008.    Oxycodone     9,000   3,234    11,000   1,807    15,000   4    23,000   1,726    Above 23,000   13    Totals   6,784    Hydrocodone     9,000   3,236    18,000   1,807    33,000   1,733    Above 33,000   8    Totals   6,784    Alprazolam     5.300   3,236    7,000   1,806    13,000   1,736    Above 13,000   6    Totals   6,784    Phentermine     1,200   3,236    1,400   1,807    1,700   1,741    Above 1,700   0    Totals   6,784    ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGED/CONI fill M i \l,    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL    CAH MDL2804 03309970     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1964-7  Filed:  07/23/19  13 of 13.  PagelD #: 163456    2.    If the controlled substance quantities from the targeted pharmacies were deleted would the thresholds decrease?    When formulating the ranges for Small, Medium, and Large classifications, all pharmacies where controlled substance sales had been discontinued as a result of a QRA decision were excluded from the analysis. Therefore, it would not change the current thresholds. Additionally, the current thresholds are established based on total Rx sales for a six month period, not controlled substance quantities or dosage unit purchases.    3.    For controlled substances - does the SOM system have the capability of checking orders of unusual size, orders deviating substantially from a normal pattern and orders of unusual frequency even if below the threshold (monitoring from the initial order)?    The current SOM system identifies orders that exceed the threshold limit that has been established for each customer. The program maintains a running count of the number of dosage units purchased by a customer each month. If a customer attempts to purchase more than the threshold limit, the order is cut and is not shipped. As part of the Anti-Diversion program going forward, analysis will be conducted to identify orders that deviate substantially from the customer's normal purchase pattern. This reporting and analysis will be retrospective and will not be conducted in real-time as the current SOM has been established. It is contemplated in a future enhancement if feasible that accounts will be identified by a different report where the weekly purchase aggregate by the customer exceeds a percentage threshold of then existing patterns of purchases [designed to capture spikes within a threshold limitation].    4.    Does the Cardinal SOM system go beyond the ASB system?    Cardinal's SOM program, based on available information, meets or exceeds the ASB system.    5.    If we were to change from dollars to dosage units would there be an impact on determining small, medium and large?    Yes, there would be a significant impact. Utilizing dosage units would potentially allow ""risk"" customers to order, and receive, more controlled substances. For example, a ""risk"" customer would be one that exclusively orders hydrocodone and has controlled substance account for 100% of its overall purchases. Since dosage units of hydrocodone are relatively inexpensive, this customer, basing size classification on dollars, would more than likely be classified as ""Small."" If we used dosage units, the customer would more than likely be identified as a ""Large"" customer due to their high orders of hydrocodone. Ultimately, Cardinal could be providing more hydrocodone to a customer who exhibits indicators of diversion (i.e. large % of controlled substance purchases and uneven product mix).    6.    If we only used controlled substances in our determination would there be an impact on determining small, medium and   large?    Yes, there would be an impact. As in the previous example, if only controlled substance sales were used, then the potential exists to provide higher limits to ""risk"" customers. If a customer has high controlled substances purchases, and no other purchases, the customer could be classified as Large and be given a higher limit. The result would be contrary to the purpose of the program by enabling potential diversion in larger quantities as a result of the classification. Additionally, the December 27, 2007 letter of the Drug Enforcement Administration clearly contemplates an action by a wholesaler to use the purchase of controlled substances in the absence of other prescription drugs and products as a factor in consideration of whether such a customer is potentially engaged in unlawful drug diversion.

And  if you  KNOW of any other  customers that are  illegal   internet  pharmacies,   you  have an obligation to prevent them from getting  controlled  substances  as well.     You  need  some  sort of do  not  sell   or do  not  ship  list  if there  are  customers  like  this.     I  am not advising you on  shipping  other drugs at the  moment.     One thing at a time.     We  can talk about  public health  policy and what the  company wants to do about that at a later date.    --------Original   Message--------    From:   Mone,   Michael   [mailto:Michael.Mone@cardinalhealth.com]    Sent:   Monday,   January 07,   2008  3:37  PM    To:   Avergun,   Jodi    Cc:   Ron.Buzzeo@dendrite.com;   Paul.Hamby@dendrite.com;   Cacciatore,   Gary;    jfokas@bakerlaw.com;   jcarney@bakerlaw.com;   Goldsand,   Corey;   Falk,   Steve    Subject:   Re:   Possible  Suspect  Pharmacy    Jodi,   I do agree that  from a purely analytical   reasoning  pov there  is  no distinction,   however when  one  looks  at the   regulatory jurisdiction of DEA the  internet sales of non  controlled  substances  is  outside their jurisdiction    While  I was  not  present when  the  decision  on  this account was  made,   I understand their  reasoning  at that time.     This  pharmacy is  located  in a jurisdiction where  the official   gavernment  policy is to encourage  its citizens  to obtain  their drugs  from Canada.    Now,   notwithstanding  the  above  if it is your expert opinion  that we  not sell   any medicinal   drugs  to any customer who  is  engaged  in  the dispensing of drugs  pursuant to  internet prescriptions,   I would  concur.    My  reasoning  to  support  such  a decision  is  based  on the  potential   public health  consequences associated with  such dispensing  as  antidepressants and  their association with  teenage  suicides.    Please  let me  know at your earliest your advice  so that we  can  implement a procedure  to address this account and  any others  that may be  engaged solely in  internet dispensing  of non  controlled.

So   ...   here,   you  have  an  Inet  Pharmacy,   the account  is open,   and  Cardinal   does  not yet  have a system for detecting all suspicious orders.     Do you  know whether this  pharmacy still   has  never ordered  controlled  subtstances? And will   not do  so?    At a minimum,   very, very,   minimum,   this account must  be  placed  on  a list that prevents all of Cardinal's ordering  systems  from accepting  orders  for  controlleds from this  customer.     And  the  PBC,   his manager,   the warehouse  head  and the  compliance  lead must  be told  that they all   have  a  responsibility to ensure  that this  customer  is  not getting  controlleds  from Cardinal.

PagelD #: 163461    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY    In Fall 2012, the Board of Directors (the ""Board"") of Cardinal Health, Inc. (""Cardinal Health"" or the ""Company"") received a letter purporting to be a shareholder demand pursuant to Ohio Rev. Civ. P. 23.1, et seq. (the ""Demand Letter"" or the ""Letter"").   The Letter asserts that the Immediate Suspension Order that the Drug Enforcement Agency (the ""DEA"") issued to the Company in February 2012 (the ""2012 ISO"") was the result of a failure by the Company ""to implement systems to detect and prevent the diversion of controlled substances into the illegal market."" (Demand Letter at 1.) Further, the Letter alleges that the Directors and Officers of the Company breached their fiduciary duties when they ""knowingly and/or recklessly failed to establish"" such a system, in violation of the Controlled Substances Act and the Memorandum of Agreement between the Company and the DEA in 2008 (the ""2008 MOA""). (Id at 10.)    On November 2,2012, the Board appointed a special demand committee (the ""Special Committee"" or the ""Committee"") to investigate and evaluate the Demand Letter. The Special Committee is composed of the two most recent additions to the Board, Clayton M. Jones, who has been a Director since September 2012 and is not named in the Demand Letter, and Dave P. King, who has been a Director since September 2011. The Special Committee retained Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP (""Milbank"") to assist with the investigation. |    I The Special Committee concludes that the document review and interview process was methodical and comprehensive.    Based on the information the Committee gathered during its investigation, and its understanding of the applicable law, the Committee does not believe that it is in the best interest of the Company to pursue claims for breach of fiduciary duty against the Directors and Officers of the Company, as requested by the Demand Letter. The investigation shows that the Board at all times acted diligently and in good faith to fulfill its duties to the Company and the Company's shareholders.    A director will be liable for damages only ""if it is proved by clear and convincing evidence... that the director's action or failure to act involved an act or omission undertaken with deliberate intent to cause injury to the corporation or undertaken with reckless disregard for the best interests of the corporation."" Ohio Rev. Code � 1701.59(E). Directors satisfy their obligation to remain informed of the corporation's activities if a reasonable information and reporting system exists within the company. See In re CaremarkInt7Inc. Deriv. Litig., 698 A.2d 959,970-71 (Del. Ch. 1996). Where a reporting system exists, ""[directors will be potentially liable for breach of their oversight duty only if they ignore 'red flags' that actually come to their attention, warning of compliance problems."" Stanleyv. Arnold,No. L12-CV-482, 2012 WL 5269147, at *6 (S.D. Ohio Oct. 23,2012) (quoting Forsythe v. CIBCEmp. Private Equity Fund, No. 657-N, 2006 Del. Ch. LEXIS 60, at *7 (Del. Ch. Mar. 22, 2006)).    Following the 2008 MOA, the Company implemented an extensive and robust system of internal controls to detect and report suspicious orders of controlled substances. The Company    1    CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY    CAH_HOUSE-003334 CAH MDL PRIORPROD HOUSE 0003334     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1964-8  Filed:  07/23/19  6 of 43.  PagelD #: 163462    hired new management with extensive regulatory and/or pharmaceutical experience, including a Chief Compliance Officer, a Senior Vice President of Quality and Regulatory Affairs, and a Vice President of Anti-Diversion, and built an anti-diversion group with experienced investigators, pharmacists, and analysts to review potential new customers and to monitor existing customers for risks of diversion. Further, the Company assigned ""threshold"" ordering volumes for each customer based on a statistical analysis of ordering data, and created an electronic monitoring system to track customers' orders against their pre-assigned threshold limits. The Company continued to enhance the electronic monitoring system and the underlying data. In addition, the Company developed a model to evaluate existing customers against customers that had been terminated as posing unreasonable risks of diversion, and hired a University Professor to test the model. A centralized database was created to store and track data on customers and orders, thereby facilitating the monitoring and investigation process. The Company created extensive policies and procedures applying to anti-diversion personnel, as well as the sales force and personnel in the distribution centers, including procedures for vetting new customers and monitoring orders from existing customers. The Company administered general anti-diversion training to thousands of employees, as well as targeted training on the specific policies and procedures that applied to each job function. The Board was fully informed of the implementation of these anti-diversion measures, and received regular and detailed progress reports throughout the process.    There were no red flags that the Company's new anti-diversion controls were inadequate. The general reaction to the 2012 ISO was surprise, for a number of reasons. Management and key anti-diversion personnel were of the impression that the anti-diversion system was meeting or exceeding the Company's obligations to detect and report suspicious orders. The Company benchmarked the system against those of its competitors to the extent that it could, and hired outside consultants to test and improve upon the system. The Company received little, if any feedback from the DEA about the new system. As part of the 2008 MOA, the DEA visited the Company's corporate headquarters in Dublin to review the new anti-diversion measures and inspected five distribution centers. Although the DEA identified some issues with one of these facilities, the Company rectified those issues and the DEA did not take any formal action. Moreover, the DEA conducted numerous routine inspections of these and other distribution centers from 2008 through the end of 2011, issued no negative findings regarding the anti-diversion controls in place at any of the facilities, and, during some of the inspections, made positive comments indicating that they were impressed, or at least satisfied with the compliance measures that were in place at the facilities. Management informed the Board of the successful inspections, i                                                                                                                    i    1                                                            I Thft RnarH wag ahn infnrmpH that pntianrempnU tn fhp    system in 2011 increased the accuracy of the system and significantly reduced the number of ""false positives,"" or legitimate customers whose orders were flagged.    The Demand Letter fails to identify a single red flag following the 2008 MOA that would have indicated that the Company's anti-diversion measures were inadequate. Instead, the Letter tries to draw a connection between the allegations that the DEA levied against the Company in the suspension orders and order to show cause it issued in 2007 and 2008 (the ""2007/2008 Action"") and the allegations at issue in 2012. In other words, the events surrounding the    2    CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY    CAH_HOUSE-003335 CAH MDL PRIORPROD HOUSE 0003335     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1964-8  Filed:  07/23/19  7 of 43.  PagelD #: 163463    2007/2008 Action were the red flags that the anti-diversion measures were inadequate leading up to the 2012 ISO. The problem with this theory is two-fold. First, as discussed, the Company instituted an entirely new anti-diversion system following the 2007/2008 Action. The Lakeland, Florida distribution center that was suspended by the 2012 ISO, one of the facilities at issue in the 2007/2008 Action, had been reinstated in late 2008, and underwent a successful inspection by the DEA pursuant to the 2008 MOA in early 2009 and a successful cyclical inspection by the DEA in 2010. Second, the events at issue in the 2012 ISO were different from those at issue in the 2007/2008 Action. The 2012 ISO involved the sale of oxycodone, while the 2007/2008 Action involved the sale of hydrocodone. In addition, the pharmacies at issue in the 2012 ISO were different from those at issue in 2007/2008 Action. Lastly, the 2012 ISO apparently stemmed from an unannounced shift by the DEA to a strict emphasis on volume, both for retail independent pharmacies, as well as for chain pharmacies,    Moreover, the facts surrounding the pharmacies at issue in the 2012 ISO make clear that the Company's anti-diversion system did not fail, but largely succeeded, r�^�""""                 I    | Ultimately, the Company terminated the two independent pharmacies as customers, and significantly decreased its shipments of oxycodone to the two chain pharmacy stores at issue, months before the 2012 ISO.    The factual and legal deficiencies in the proposed action make it reasonably likely that the action would be dismissed before a decision on the merits, or that the action would conclude with a finding that the directors and officers fulfilled their fiduciary duties to the Company. The facts make clear that the Company implemented a robust system of internal controls to detect and report suspicious orders, and that the Board was well-informed of those controls. The directors did not fail to act in the face of any red flags that the Company's anti-diversion controls were inadequate.    The Committee also concludes that a review of other factors supports its determination that litigation of the sort requested in the Demand Letter is not in the best interests of the Company. The Committee employed its business judgment to consider all of the corporate interests that may weigh in favor of pursuing the proposed action. The proposed action would be certain to consume tremendous Company resources, and would present a significant distraction for management and employees of the Company. In addition, it is likely that the Company would be obligated to indemnify the directors for their costs in defending against the proposed action, pursuant to the Indemnification Agreement that nearly all of the present and former directors signed, or the indemnification provision contained in the Restated Code of Regulations of Cardinal Health, Inc., which applies to the remainder of the directors. The Committee finds that the expense of reimbursing the directors for litigation costs weighs against accepting the demand to pursue claims with a limited probability of success.    For the foregoing reasons, the Special Committee recommends that the Company not pursue the action requested by the Demand Letter.    3    CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY    CAH_HOUSE-003336 CAH MDL PRIORPROD HOUSE 0003336     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1964-8 Filed: 07/23/19 8 of 43.  PagelD #: 163464    REPORT OF THE SPECIAL DEMAND COMMITTEE    I.         THE DEMAND    A.       Allegations    On September 28, 2012, Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP sent a letter purporting to be a ""Shareholder Demand Pursuant to Ohio R. Civ. P. 23.1, et seq"" (the ""Demand Letter"" or the ""Letter"") on behalf of Isabelle Rauch, a purported shareholder of Cardinal Health, Inc. (""Cardinal Health"" or the ""Company""), to George S. Barrett, Chairman of the Board of Directors (the ""Board"") of the Company. The Letter alleges that the Order to Show Cause and Immediate Suspension of Registration issued by the Drug Enforcement Agency (the ""DEA"") in February 2012 regarding the Company's Lakeland, Florida distribution center (the ""2012 ISO"") was the result of a failure by the Company ""to implement systems to detect and prevent the diversion of controlled substances into the illegal market"" in accordance with the Controlled Substances Act (the ""CSA""), the Memorandum of Agreement entered with the DEA in 2008 (the ""2008 MOA""), and DEA ""directives.""1 (Demand Letter at 1, 10.) Further, the Letter alleges that certain ""Directors and Officers,"" defined as twenty-two present and former directors, ""breached their duties of loyalty and care when they knowingly and/or recklessly failed to establish"" such a system of internal controls. (Id. at 10.)    About four pages of the ten-page letter describe the three Orders to Show Cause and Immediate Suspensions of Registration issued against the Company in 2007 (the ""2007 ISOs""), the Order to Show Cause issued in 2008 (together with the 2007 ISOs, the ""2007/2008 Action""), the Memorandum of Agreement entered into with the DEA in 2008 (the ""2008 MOA""), and the civil penalty levied in connection with the 2008 MOA. (Id. at 2-5.) The Letter details the DEA's allegations in the 2007/2008 Action that the Company distributed excessive quantities of hydrocodone and failed to maintain effective controls against diversion at seven of its twenty-seven distribution centers. (Id.) As further described in the Letter, the Company agreed to ""maintain a compliance program designed to detect and prevent diversion of controlled substances as required under the CSA and applicable DEA regulations."" (Id. at 4.) The Letter then discusses the 2012 ISO issued in connection with the Lakeland, Florida facility, one of the facilities that was suspended in 2007, and the DEA's allegation that the Lakeland facility distributed excessive volumes of oxycodone to four Florida pharmacies despite ""warning signs,"" and thus did not have adequate controls in place. (Id. at 5-8.) According to the Letter, ""[i]t was widely reported that the Company's failure to comply with the 2008 MOA was at least a partial basis for the 2012 ISO.""

(See infra Part IV.B.3.C.) As part of the 2008 MOA, the Company agreed, among other things, to implement a system in which ""[o]rders that exceed established thresholds and criteria will be reviewed by a Cardinal employee trained to detect suspicious orders for the purpose of determining whether (i) such orders should not be filled and reported to the DEA or (ii) based on a detailed review, the order is for a legitimate purpose and the controlled substances are not likely to be diverted into other than legitimate medical, scientific, or industrial channels.""

The results of the recent investigation strongly indicated to me that, contrary to its promises in the 2008 MOA, Cardinal had not maintained adequate anti-diversion measures at its Lakeland facility."")).)    The Letter claims that, as a result of the 2012 ISO, the Company ""has and will continue to suffer significant harm and incur substantial costs, including, but not limited to, potential fines, attorneys' fees, consulting fees, loss of business, and reputational harm,"" as well as damage to the Company's ""corporate image and good-will."" (Demand Letter at 9.) Finally, the Letter demands that the Board ""take action against the Directors and Officers to recover the damages described herein for the benefit of the Company."" (Id. at 10.)    B.        Formation of Special Demand Committee    On November 2,2012, the Board appointed a special demand committee (the ""Special Committee"" or the ""Committee"") to investigate and evaluate the Demand Letter. ^^^""^^^    I                                                                                                                     I Mr. Jones,    who is not named in the Demand Letter, is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Rockwell Collins, Inc., an aviation electronics and communications equipment company, and is a Director of Deere & Company, an agricultural and construction machinery manufacturer.

After receiving proposals from four law firms, and interviewing two firms, the Special Committee retained Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP (""Milbank"") to assist with the investigation.    H.  RELEVANT LEGAL STANDARDS    Ohio law provides that ""[a] director shall be liable in damages ... only if it is proved by clear and convincing evidence... that the director's action or failure to act involved an act or omission undertaken with deliberate intent to cause injury to the corporation or undertaken with reckless disregard for the best interests of the corporation.""

Document Collection and Review    Milbank worked closely with the Company to collect documents relevant to the allegations contained in the Demand Letter, including documents relating to the Company's anti-diversion policies and procedures, as well as communications and materials provided to the Board and the Audit Committee about those policies and procedures. The Company cooperated with the investigation fully and at all times. |                                                                 1    I                                                                                                                 I These    documents included Standard Operating Procedures (""SOPs"") and handbooks relating to anti-diversion measures, internal Company training materials, corporate governance guidelines and charters, and organizational charts. Milbank also reviewed the extensive court filings and accompanying exhibits from the 2012 proceedings with the DEA before the Administrative Law Judge, the District Court for the District of Columbia, and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, as well as court filings and exhibits from the three derivative actions filed against the Board in May and June 2012. i                                                                  i    A team of Milbank attorneys reviewed each document to determine its significance to the investigation. The Special Committee concludes that Milbank's document collection and review was thorough and systematic.    B.

Lastly, Milbank interviewed counsel for the shareholder, Lindsay Roseler and Michael Hynes, of Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP. Thirteen of the interviews were conducted in person, and ten of the interviews were conducted by telephone. The length of the interviews ranged from approximately thirty minutes to three hours, with most interviews lasting about one to two hours.    The purpose of interviewing upper-level management was to understand the Company's anti-diversion measures as they apply to those individuals and the individuals in their departments, how those measures changed since 2007 and the reasons for those changes, and how those changes were communicated to the Board. For lower-level employees, the goal of the interviews was to determine their knowledge of the anti-diversion policies and procedures as they apply to their job functions, how those policies and procedures evolved from 2007 through 2012, whether employees adhere to those policies and procedures in the day-to-day execution of their duties, and the effectiveness of training programs relating to anti-diversion. The purpose in interviewing the Audit Committee members was to verify that the Board and the Audit Committee were informed about the Company's anti-diversion measures, as well as any diversion problems or issues.    The Special Committee concludes that Milbank's interviews were comprehensive, both in terms of the topics addressed and the individuals who were interviewed.    IV.     ANTI-DIVERSION POLICIES AND PROCEDURES    A.       Anti-Diversion Measures Before the 2007 ISOs    In the years preceding the 2007 ISOs, the Company's anti-diversion measures focused mainly on preventing price diversion4 and diversion by internet pharmacies. There was a small group of employees involved in anti-diversion measures, including a Vice President of QRA, a QRA director, and employees at each division who were responsible for some compliance-related tasks, in addition to non-compliance responsibilities.    'Trice diversion"" refers to the practice of non-retail pharmacies purchasing pharmaceuticals from a wholesaler at contract or discount prices, and then reselling the pharmaceuticals at higher prices on the open market.    7    CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY    CAH_HOUSE-003340 CAH MDL PRIORPROD HOUSE 0003340     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1964-8  Filed:  07/23/19  12 of 43.  PagelD #: 163468    During this time, there was no electronic system for analyzing orders. The Company relied on sales data from the previous month, and thus there was a thirty-day lag time for information. In addition, most of the files on customers and orders were on paper, rather than electronic, and located in various places. In August 2005, Cardinal Health met with the DEA to discuss internet pharmacies and the DEA provided the Company with monthly dosage unit quantities for hydrocodone, phentermine, and alprazolam to assist with monitoring for internet pharmacy activity. The Company implemented a system to review customer orders based on that data, and also provided the information to sales personnel. Further, each division provided a monthly Ingredient Limit Report to the DEA, which identified customers whose monthly purchase quantities exceeded certain predetermined amounts. (Required Reports to DEA, June    15.2006, at 6.) In addition, employees in the distribution centers were expected to identify and report suspicious or excessive purchases of controlled substances to their superiors.    The evaluation of new customers during this time focused on whether the pharmacy allowed customers to order prescriptions over the internet or filled prescriptions for customers of other internet pharmacies. (Internet Pharmacies: Customer Approval and Oversight Policy, Apr.    13.2007, at 1.)    During Spring and Summer 2006, there were live training sessions for employees at six locations around the country, focused primarily on price diversion and diversion by internet pharmacies. The Company also developed and implemented two mandatory computer-based trainings in August and December 2007 for all sales personnel and field operations managers, which also focused on internet pharmacy diversion.    B.       Anti-Diversion Measures from the 2007 ISOs through the 2012 ISO    Before 2007, the DEA's enforcement efforts seemed to be primarily aimed at internet pharmacies. The 2007/2008 Action signaled to the Company that the DEA's enforcement efforts had expanded to include distributors, particularly with respect to sales to retail independent pharmacies affiliated with internet pharmacies. In response to the 2007/2008 Action, and in an attempt to try to anticipate the DEA's next area of focus, the Company set out to build a new anti-diversion program. Over time, the Company added more than forty positions and invested approximately $25 million in the new system. (Declaration of Craig Morford Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. � 1746, In re Cardinal Health, No. 12-32 (DEA Administrative Law Judge (""ALT') Apr. 12,2012) (""Morford Decl.""), lfl 5,7.)    i                               I (Amended Declaration of Michael A.

Mone was a pharmacist and an attorney, whose prior experience included representing the Board of Pharmacy as counsel with the Florida Department of Professional Regulation, representing the Boards of Chiropractic, Osteopathic Medicine, and Veterinary Medicine as Assistant Attorney General in Florida, and acting as Executive Director of the Kentucky Board of Pharmacy. (See id. 1] 2.)  One of Mone's first actions was to build out the anti-diversion group.

In addition, the Company hired twenty-four compliance officers, who would be based at the Company's distribution centers and would oversee various compliance measures, including the anti-diversion measures applying to distribution centers. The compliance officers would be part of the QRA group and would report to Steve Reardon, Vice President of QRA, via regional directors.    J Morford had extensive leadership and    regulatory experience, as a former U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee and the Eastern District of Michigan and the former Acting U.S. Deputy Attorney General, overseeing the various U.S. Attorney offices and agencies within the Justice Department.

(Declaration of Gilberto Quintero Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. � 1746, In re Cardinal Health, No. 12-32 (DEA AU Apr. 13,2012) (""Quintero Decl."") 1J 4.) Quintero came to the Company with extensive experience in regulatory and compliance issues from his former role at Wyeth Pharmaceuticals. (Id. 1J 3.)    The Company set a strong tone that anti-diversion was the responsibility of every employee. (Morford Decl. Tf 5.) By the end of 2008, the Company had begun implementing a host of new policies and procedures designed to detect and report suspicious orders. In particular, the Company implemented detailed procedures for reviewing potential new customers and for monitoring existing customers. The procedures for reviewing potential new customers would apply to the anti-diversion group, as well as the salespeople in the field. (Suspicious Order Monitoring Presentation, Feb. 2009, at 7-10.) The monitoring of existing customers would involve the creation of a new electronic monitoring system (at times referred to as the ""Suspicious Order Monitoring"" or ""SOM"" system), as well as specific duties for the anti-diversion group, the salespeople, and the employees at the distribution centers. (Id at 7-14.) The Company administered extensive mandatory training on the anti-diversion policies and procedures. (Id. at 15-16.) The Company hired consultants to review and test the anti-diversion system, and tried to gauge the DEA's response to the system in communications with DEA personnel and by carefully observing the DEA's cyclical inspections of distribution centers.5    1.       Review of Potential New Customers    In January 2008, the Company issued standard operating procedures (""SOPs"") that required the anti-diversion group to evaluate any potential new retail independent customer to    5         The DEA conducts routine cyclical inspections (sometimes referred to as ""audits"") of    manufacturers and distributors of controlled substances and regulated chemicals.

The procedures required salespeople, in conjunction with the potential new customer, to complete a New Retail Independent Pharmacy Questionnaire, commonly referred to as a ""Know Your Customer""7 questionnaire (the ""New Customer Questionnaire""). (New Customer Survey Process, at 1.) The New Customer Questionnaire required information about the pharmacy's business, including the pharmacy's DEA and state licenses, whether there were any prior disciplinary actions, such as revocation or suspension of licenses, the method by which the pharmacy received prescriptions, whether the pharmacy filled prescriptions for out of state patients, the pharmacy's expected usage for certain products, and whether there were any local pain or weight loss clinics in the area and the proximity of any such clinics. (See New Customer Questionnaire, Jan. 4,2008.) The procedures also required the salespeople to take photos of the interior and exterior of the pharmacy and to send the photos to the anti-diversion group for review. In addition, all new retail independent customers were required to sign a DEA compliance agreement titled, ""Compliance Representations and Warranties for Pharmacy Customers."" (New Customer Survey Process, at 2.)    The anti-diversion group was responsible for the review and analysis of potential new accounts. (New Account Approval, Dec. 22, 2008, at 1.) In 2010, three analysts were hired to focus on reviewing potential new accounts. The analysts reviewed the New Customer Questionnaires to verify the information that the customer provided and look for common indicia of diversion, such as high percentage of cash payments, unjustifiably high percentage of controlled substance sales, and out-of-state patients or prescribers. (See New Customer Survey Process, at 2; Declaration of Nicholas Rausch Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. � 1746, In re Cardinal Health, No. 12-32 (DEA ALJ Apr. 13, 2012), If 11.) If there were any concerns, a pharmacist in the anti-diversion group would review the data on the potential new customer and decide whether to open the account, refer the case for additional investigation, or decline the account. (Feb. 6 Mone Decl. 112.)    For new chain pharmacy customers, the Company would obtain information about the chain's number of stores, anticipated usage, and internal anti-diversion procedures. (Feb. 6 Mone Decl. If 13.) If a chain sought to open a new pharmacy, the corporate office would need to provide Cardinal Health with the new pharmacy's state license and DEA registration. (Id. \ 14.)    Regarding the SOPs generally, the actual practices were constantly being improved or modified, and those changes would be reflected in subsequent versions of the SOPs. With respect to the New Customer Survey Process, a revised version was issued in October 2009.    7          ""Know Your Customer"" or ""KYC"" is a term used within the Company to refer to the diligence    measures for reviewing and monitoring potential and existing customers.    10    CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY    CAH_HOUSE-003343 CAH  MDL PRIORPROD HOUSE 0003343     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1964-8  Filed:  07/23/19  15 of 43.  PagelD #: 163471    2.         Monitoring Existing Customers    a.        Electronic Sales Monitoring    In 2007, the Company began building out the technology and infrastructure for an electronic system that would store data about customers and monitor orders. At that time, the Company's data on customers was located in various places and largely on paper. Further, there was no analytical capability or real-time data for reviewing orders. Mone and Rausch worked with the Company's IT group to build the electronic monitoring system. The system was built on top of the order fulfillment system, so that it could draw from the data in the order fulfillment system.    In late 2007 through early 2008, the Company implemented the basic components of the electronic monitoring system. The Company engaged Deloitte to help develop the analytical methodology for setting thresholds. In 2008, Mone and Rausch began conducting informal ""benchmarking"" of the electronic monitoring system, engaging in arms' length communications with other distributors about their respective systems. Those efforts continued through the years.    In 2010, the Company partnered with IBM to create Anti-Diversion Centralization (""ADC""), a central repository that allowed all data on a particular customer to be stored and accessible on a single platform. (Quintero Decl. If 7.) The new system made the process of reviewing customers much easier, both for pharmacists reviewing orders and for investigators preparing for site visits, because all of the data on customers was captured in one place. In addition, ADC provided a better sense of the ""whole picture,"" showing more comprehensive and detailed information about the customer. The program showed all of the information that had been collected about the customer, prior held orders, communications about prior held orders, and graphs depicting previous orders and fluctuations in orders, all of which assisted pharmacists in reviewing orders. ADC also captured the pharmacists' decisions about whether to release the order and allow it to be filled or to delete the order and not allow it to be filled.    (i)        Setting Thresholds    When the electronic system was created in 2008, thresholds were set by identifying a ""baseline"" drug quantity for one month, using the mean volume for each drug family for each class of trade. The customers were segmented into four main classes of trade: retail independents, chains, hospitals, and long-term care.8 The stores were segmented by size (small, medium, and large) and thresholds were set for each size category using multiples of 3, 5, or 8, depending on the drug family, based in part on multiples that the DEA had previously provided    The system first focused on the four highest risk drugs and on retail independent pharmacies, because those were the pharmacies at issue in the 2007/2008 Action and were thought to pose the highest risk of diversion. As 2008 progressed, the remaining 106 drugs were included and the system was expanded to include long-term care, then hospitals, and then chain pharmacies.    11    CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY    CAH_HOUSE-003344 CAH  MDL PRIORPROD HOUSE 0003344     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1964-8  Filed:  07/23/19  16 of 43.  PagelD #: 163472    for certain combination products9 containing those controlled substances. Thus, the system was designed to create an ""alert"" if the volume for a particular store exceeded the assigned threshold.    If a new retail independent pharmacy provided ordering and dispensing information, a pharmacist would create a customized threshold for the pharmacy, taking into account the size and location of the pharmacy, its history of dispensing, the normal wholesale package size of drugs ordered, the number of different strengths within a given family of controlled substances, the availability of generic drugs for the controlled substances, and whether the pharmacy used automated dispensing. (Feb. 6 Mone Decl. If 16.) SOPs issued in December 2008 outlined the specific steps for calculating thresholds: (1) extract and formulate a list of customers that have purchased monitored items and historical sales data for those customers for all monitored items; (2) differentiate customers through segmentation by size and/or specialty; (3) evaluate historical controlled substance sales data per drug family, per month for each customer segment to establish appropriate threshold limits, using the multiples of 3, 5, or 8; (4) incorporate background information about the pharmacies to establish final threshold limits; and (5) apply rounding logic and finalize threshold limits.10 (Process to Establish SOM Threshold Limits, Dec. 22, 2008, at 2-4.) Thus, a baseline was first established for all ""monitored items,"" which included any controlled substances. (Id. at 1.) The baseline was then adjusted up by a statistically significant factor or variable to formulate the threshold limit for the pharmacy. (Id.) If a new retail independent pharmacy did not provide dispensing data, the pharmacy would receive the mid-level threshold limit. (Feb. 6 Mone Decl. If 16.) The Company did not inform customers of their threshold limits. (Id)    Thresholds for new chain stores were based on a standard threshold for the entire chain, because chain stores usually have a known ordering pattern for the majority of stores. (Id. \ 17.) The Company also took into account the chain's anti-diversion measures in setting thresholds. (See Supplemental Declaration of Nicholas Rausch Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. � 1746, In re Cardinal Health, No. 12-32 (DEA ALJ Apr. 23, 2012) (""Rausch Supplemental Decl""), f 5.)    (ii)       Monitoring Thresholds    In the beginning, the system was primarily focused on volume, and whether the order was more than two standard deviations away from the mean. As it evolved, it looked at other metrics, many of which were based on guidance that the DEA provided in letters to distributors and manufacturers, such as the ratio of controlled to non-controlled substances and percentage of cash sales. As the system progressed further, it incorporated regression analyses to review volatility, and the behavior of the individual customer. Thus, the flagging of an order for volume triggered a review of other data, such as order frequency and history.    The DEA provided guidance to chemical distributors approving the use of multiples of three and eight for drug products consisting of a listed chemical and a controlled substance. (See Drug Enforcement Administration Office of Diversion Control, ""Knowing Your Customer/Suspicious Order Reporting,"" http ://www. deadiversion.usdoj .gov/chem_prog/susp .htm.)    10        Each of these steps included a number of sub-steps. A revised version of the Process to Establish    SOM Threshold Limits was issued in January 2010.    12    CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY    CAH_HOUSE-003345 CAH  MDL PRIORPROD HOUSE 0003345     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1964-8  Filed:  07/23/19  17 of 43.  PagelD #: 163473    In 2010, Quintero asked the Pricing Analytics group to develop a system to identify outlying customers. In 2011, the Company hired a full time statistician for the purpose of maintaining and enhancing the system. This individual was asked to analyze customers that had been terminated as posing unreasonable risks of diversion to determine if there were similarities in the buying patterns of these customers, both in terms of changes in volumes and combinations of drugs. In June 2011, the Company implemented a logistical regression model that compared those customers to existing customers. Thus, the system would flag independent pharmacies whose ordering patterns began to emulate the ordering patterns of customers previously terminated as posing risks of diversion, prompting additional investigation of the customer.11 (Feb. 6 Mone Decl. If 22.) The model was validated by the Chair of the Department of Integrated Systems Engineering of Ohio State University. (Id.)    The analysts in Rausch's group were responsible for monitoring threshold events. SOPs issued in December 2008 outlined the procedures for the daily reporting of threshold events within the Company.12 (Daily Threshold Reporting, Dec. 22, 2008, at 1.) In addition, the electronic monitoring system would generate an early dialogue notice when a customer's order caused it to reach 75% of its monthly threshold. (Feb. 6 Mone Decl. If 18.)    b.        Monitoring by Salespeople    Salespeople were not usually aware of their customer's thresholds, but they were expected to monitor their customers using other methods. In 2008, the sales force started receiving ""Highlight Reports,"" which were monthly reports that identified ""Red Flag"" or ""Yellow Flag Customers"" based on certain percentage increases in their controlled substance orders. (See generally, Sales - Highlight Report, Dec. 22, 2008.) SOPs issued in December 2008 required salespeople to visit their Red Flag Customers within ten working days to look for signs of diversion and complete an online Customer Visit form.13 (Id. at 3.) For Yellow Flag Customers, salespeople were required to contact the customer as soon as possible to understand the reason for the increased ordering and look for signs of diversion. (Id.) If the customer had been a Yellow Flag Customer for consecutive months, the salesperson or an investigator was required to visit the customer within fifteen business days. (Id) In 2009, the SOPs were revised to define ""Red Flag Customers"" as customers whose orders of controlled substances or List 1 chemicals increased by 15% (where the increase was at least $10,000), and ""Yellow Flag Customers"" as customers whose orders increased by 10% (where the increase was at least    In or around June 2011, the Company also developed multiple linear regression models for chain pharmacies, based on the chains' buying patterns for certain classes of drugs.    12         The SOPS provided that the IT department would send a report of the order to the anti-diversion group, which would record the order into a master file, create a customer profile to use during the review of the order, and create a ""held order report."" (Daily Threshold Reporting, Dec. 22, 2008, at 2-3.) The sales group would also be informed of the threshold event. (Id. at 4-5.) A revised version of the Daily Threshold Reporting SOP was issued in January 2010.    13          The Customer Visit form included the following questions, among others: whether there were people loitering or lined up at the pharmacy or local practitioner's office; whether the pharmacy had front-end or over-the-counter merchandise; whether there was a pain management or weight loss clinic located in the general vicinity of the pharmacy; and any other observations by the salesperson. (See Supply Chain Services Documentation of Customer Visit form.)    13    CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY    CAH_HOUSE-003346 CAH  MDL PRIORPROD HOUSE 0003346     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1964-8  Filed:  07/23/19  18 of 43.  PagelD #: 163474    $5,000).     (Sales - Highlight Report, June 9, 2009, at 3.) The Highlight Reports were discontinued in or around late 2010, and eventually replaced by ordering data made available to salespeople directly through a program called ""Winwatcher."" See infra Part VI.B.2.b.    Other SOPs issued in December 2008 required salespeople to perform an ""early dialogue"" with customers whose orders neared their threshold by a certain percentage. (Sales -Early Dialogue, Dec. 22, 2008, at 2.) The procedures required salespeople to contact the customer regarding its increase in ordering to determine whether there was a trend or data that explained the orders, such as seasonality, new business contracts, change in business model, purchase of files, or relocations. (Id.) The salesperson was required to document the relevant facts and complete a Customer Visit form. (Id. at 2-3.)    Salespeople were expected to visit their customers regularly and to look for signs of diversion on each visit. (See Suspicious Order Monitoring Presentation, Feb. 2009, at 8; Declaration of Jon Giacomin Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. � 1746, In re Cardinal Health, No. 12-32 (DEA ALJ Apr. 12, 2012) (""Giacomin Decl.""), If 10.) SOPs issued in December 2008 detailed the ""process requirements for the continuous monitoring and reporting of customer order activities by [the sales force],"" and listed ""anti-diversion alert signals"" for the sales force to be aware of when visiting customers.15 (Sales - Anti-Diversion Alert Signals, Dec. 22, 2008, at 1-2.) The alert signals included: pharmacies with minimal or no front end merchandise, little or no walk-in business, or primarily cash customers, or pharmacies soliciting buyers of controlled substances via the internet; orders containing a high percentage of controlled substances relative to non-controlled substances, or excessive quantities of a limited variety of controlled substances; and one or more practitioners writing a disproportionate share of the prescriptions for controlled substances being filled. (Id. at 2.) The SOPs required the salesperson to complete an online Customer Visit form and to assess a risk level for the customer if two or more of the anti-diversion alert signals were present. (Id.)    As discussed above, salespeople were notified if one of their customers experienced a threshold event. (See supra note 12.) SOPs issued in December 2008 required the customer to complete a Threshold Event Survey.16 (Sales - Investigation, Dec. 22,2008, at 2.) Following completion of the survey, the anti-diversion group might determine that a site visit was necessary and alert the salesperson, who might be asked to accompany an investigator on a site visit of the pharmacy. (Id at 3.)    In 2008, the Company revised the compensation policies for salespeople, to encourage salespeople to report customers who may pose risks of diversion. In particular, the Company instituted a policy that if a customer was terminated as a diversion risk, the salesperson's sales goals would be reduced by the portion attributable to that customer. (See Giacomin Decl. Tf 12.)    The Sales - Highlight Report SOP was revised again in January 2010. A revised version of these SOPs was issued in June 2009. A revised version of these SOPs was issued in June 2009.    14    CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY    CAH_HOUSE-003347 CAH  MDL PRIORPROD HOUSE 0003347     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1964-8  Filed:  07/23/19  19 of 43.  PagelD #: 163475    c.        Monitoring at the Distribution Centers    Compliance officers and other employees at the distribution centers were also responsible for monitoring orders. SOPs issued in April 2009 required compliance officers to review monthly reports of the top twenty-five retail independent purchasers of commonly diverted drugs1 (""Top 25 Reports""), to identify customers of concern, and to participate in ""ride alongs"" with salespeople to visit customers of concern.18 (Compliance Officer: Duties and Responsibilities, Apr. 17, 2009, at 1.)    In addition, the supervisor in the cage/vault area, as well as at least one other employee in the cage/vault, were required to review ""Large Order Reports,"" which would identify all orders over a certain quantity (as identified by the anti-diversion group).19 (Cage/Vault SOM Process, Dec, 2, 2008, at 1.) The Large Order Reports would be reviewed before the orders were packaged to look for any ""Orders of Interest,"" defined as an order that appears to ""significantly deviate"" from the customer's normal ordering pattern or the normal ordering pattern for the class of customer. (Id. at 1, 3.) Employees were instructed that Orders of Interest could exhibit the following traits, among others: quantity that was not normal for the customer or the customer's class; substance that was not normal for the customer; quantity that has shown signs of a steady increase over time; or substance/quantity that did not match the season. (Id. at 3.) If any Orders of Interest were identified, the cage/vault supervisor, based on his or her knowledge or experience, could authorize the shipment or hold the order and not allow it to be filled. (Id.) If an order was held, the compliance officer and the anti-diversion group would be notified.20 (Id.)    Orders of Interest could also be identified at any time during the processing and fulfillment of the order. The Company instituted a policy in 2008 that enabled any employee at a distribution center to ""raise their hand"" and hold an order if it looked unusual. (See Suspicious Order Monitoring Presentation, Feb. 2009, at 12; Declaration of Joyce R. Butler Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. � 1746, In re Cardinal Health, No. 12-32 (DEA ALJ Apr. 12, 2012) (""Butler Decl""), If 13.) The employees in the cage and vault filled orders for the same customers on a regular basis, and thus were in a position to recognize when an order was unusual based on the size of the    17         The dmgs included hydrocodone and oxycodone. Revised versions of these SOPs were issued in 2009 and 2010.    18          The requirement for compliance officers to participate in a certain number of ride alongs each year was eliminated in 2010, as it was considered not a good use of the Compliance Officers' time. (See Compliance Officer: Duties and Responsibilities, Nov. 12,2010, at 1.) Ride alongs are now used for training new hires.    19         Revised versions of the Cage/Vault SOM Process were issued on December 9,2008, January 21, 2010, April 7,2010, April 22, 2010, and August 3,2010.    20         The customer and the appropriate sales representative were also notified if an order was held at the distribution center. The relevant sales and management team would receive an email describing the held order the following morning.    15    CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY    CAH_HOUSE-003348 CAH  MDL PRIORPROD HOUSE 0003348     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1964-8  Filed:  07/23/19  20 of 43.  PagelD #: 163476    order and the customer's ordering history. The employees were also trained to recognize indicators of diversion.21 See infra Part IV.B.4.b.    Orders of Interest were treated as threshold events and analyzed accordingly. (Cage/Vault SOM Process, Dec. 2, 2008, at 3.)    3.        Responding to Threshold Events    a.        Review of Threshold Events by Pharmacists    If a customer experienced a threshold event, i.e., when a customer's orders in a given month exceeded its threshold for a particular drug family, the order causing the overage and any subsequent orders would be held pending review. (Daily Threshold Reporting, Dec. 22, 2008, at 1.) A pharmacist would review the files on the customer and the information about the specific order. (See Rausch Supplemental Decl. ^[ 6.) The Company made a concerted effort to hire pharmacists with a variety of pharmaceutical backgrounds. Christopher Forst, Director of Pharmacy Assessment, had many years' experience as a hospital pharmacist. Two additional pharmacists were hired in 2010, with mail order and retail experience.    In December 2008, the Company issued detailed procedures for the review of threshold events. (See generally, Threshold Event Review, Self Verification; Decision Making and Threshold Outcome Communication, Dec. 22, 2008 (hereinafter, ""Threshold Event Review"").) Generally, the procedures required review of the customer's profile to determine the customer's business type, the distributor information (whether Cardinal Health was the primary or secondary distributor),22 the drug family that triggered the threshold event, the customer's total number of threshold events in general and for the specific drug family at issue, the customer's total current monthly accrual and monthly usage for the specific drug family, and the customer's monthly drug family limit. (Id. at 1-2.) The procedures then required review of the specific order to determine the type of drug family products in the held order, the quantity of drug family products in the held order, and the reasonableness of the total drug family order. (Id. at 6.) Next, the procedures called for certain decisions to be made by an individual with a degree in pharmacy, including: (1) whether the order was reasonable based on applied reasoning (looking at such factors as seasonal events, natural events, regional prescribing habits, the location of the pharmacy or facility in relation to health care providers, whether it was an end of month order, whether there was a shortage of other products, or whether the monthly limit was incorrect); (2) whether the order was excessive (for example, as a result of an order entry error or duplication); and (3) whether the order was suspicious (i.e., excessive in quantity, strength, or frequency, or an unexplainable deviation from the norm). (Id)    Employees in the cage and vault undergo rigorous screening, training, and certification processes before they are granted access to controlled substances, in accordance with DEA requirements and detailed SOPs in existence since at least May 2008. (See, e.g., Personnel, May 14,2008; Employee Screening and Training Requirements for DEA Regulated Activities, May 8,2009, and as revised, Mar. 17, 2010, June 3, 2011, and Feb. 4,2013.)    22         Certain chains have their own warehouses and vaults for stocking drugs. For these chains, their    primary source is their own warehouse system, and Cardinal Health acts as a secondary distributor, providing ""back up"" if the chain runs out of, or chooses not to stock, a particular drug.    16    CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY    CAH_HOUSE-003349 CAH  MDL PRIORPROD HOUSE 0003349     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1964-8  Filed:  07/23/19  21 of 43.  PagelD #: 163477    When an independent retail pharmacy experienced a threshold event, a pharmacist could request that the investigator conduct a ""deep dive"" investigation of the pharmacy, which included a site visit of the pharmacy.23 (See Threshold Event Review, at 18.) Investigators and pharmacists conducted occasional ""surveillance"" visits of chain pharmacies, during which they would visit the store without announcing their presence.    Distributors did not typically perform the same diligence on chain pharmacies as they did on retail independent pharmacies. (See, e.g., DEA Pharmaceutical Industry Conference: Wholesale Distribution Diversion Control Program, AmerisourceBergen Corp., Sept. 11, 2007, at 7; Declaration of Michael A. Mone Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. � 1746, In re Cardinal Health, No. 12-32 (DEA ALJ Apr. 13, 2012) (""Apr. 13 Mone Decl""), If 39.) The pharmacies at issue in the 2007/2008 Action were retail independent pharmacies, and chain pharmacies were generally believed to pose lesser risks of diversion than retail independent pharmacies. Pharmacists at chain stores usually do not share in the profits for the store, and chain pharmacies have their own anti-diversion and loss prevention systems.24 (Feb. 6 Mone Decl. If 10.) Cardinal Health communicated with the chain's corporate offices to supply information regarding orders of concern. (Apr. 13 Mone Decl. | 38.) If a chain pharmacy experienced a threshold event, the Account Manager would contact the chain's corporate office to request information regarding the order at issue and then provide the information to the anti-diversion group for review. The anti-diversion group would review the data on the order and the proffered explanation for the threshold event and respond in one of the following ways: (1) accept the explanation and temporarily increase the threshold to ship the order; (2) accept the explanation and permanently increase the threshold; (3) ask for additional information; or (4) reject the explanation and refuse to ship the order.    If a pharmacist deemed an order reasonable, he or she could release the order and, if warranted, increase the threshold in the electronic system. (Threshold Event Review at 6; see also Quality and Regulatory Affairs: Overview of Anti-Diversion Program, 2011, at 6-7.) A pharmacist could determine that an order was reasonable for a number of reasons. For example, if a customer's business model changed in a way that caused it to grow, an increase in ordering would be expected and the pharmacist might decide that an upward adjustment in the customer's threshold was appropriate. If the pharmacist deemed the order unreasonable and suspicious, he or she would delete the order and not allow it to be filled.25 (Id. at 6-7; see also Quality and Regulatory Affairs: Overview of Anti-Diversion Program, 2011, at 7.) The pharmacist's decision to release the order and allow it to be filled or to delete the order and not allow it to be filled was documented within the electronic system. (Threshold Event Review, at 14.)    In certain circumstances, pharmacists or analysts might conduct phone interviews of customers rather than conduct site visits.    24         With respect to CVS in particular, Cardinal Health and CVS conducted a webinar in 2008 in which CVS discussed its loss prevention measures. (Apr. 13 Mone Decl. If 83.)    25          If the order was unreasonable but was the result of an entry error, the pharmacist would delete the order in the system and not allow it to be filled, but would not report the order.

On-Site Investigations    The vast majority of on-site investigations were conducted in response to threshold events. Investigations would also be conducted at the request of Mone, based on information he received from his contacts in the pharmacy arena. As the electronic system became more advanced, the Company began to conduct proactive investigations in advance of threshold events.    In early 2008, the Company worked with Cedegim, a compliance consulting company, to set guidelines and processes for the investigators to follow. In December 2008, the Company issued detailed SOPs setting out the required procedures for conducting on-site investigations.26 (On-Site Investigations, Dec. 22, 2008, at 1.) The investigations were comprised of four main components: initial case preparation; background investigation; site visit; and report preparation. (Id. at 5-11.) During the initial case preparation stage, the investigator would review the Company's existing files on the customer. (Id. at 5.) Based on this information, the investigator would develop a background research plan that included reviewing licensed customer information, threshold events, customer responses to questionnaires, and previous decisions regarding shipment to the customer. (Id.)    During the background investigation, the investigator would use various internet resources to verify the information in Cardinal Health's files and conduct the background research on the pharmacy, its employees, local physicians and healthcare facilities, and geographical information. (Id. at 6.) The investigator would research any disciplinary actions against the pharmacy or its owners or employees, and any civil or criminal actions taken against the pharmacy, its employees, local physicians, or any other person associated with the pharmacy. (Id.)  The investigator would then contact an appropriate representative of the pharmacy to schedule and discuss the purpose of the visit. (Id. at 7.) The investigator would also contact the salesperson assigned to the licensed customer and offer him or her the opportunity to be present during the site visit. (Id.)    Upon entering the community and the vicinity of the pharmacy, the investigators were directed to observe and document the surroundings and to note any specifics relating to business practices, business volume, and business type, such as: the types and number of health care facilities located within the area; the types and number of medical practices, especially noting those who are characteristically heavy prescribers of controlled substances (e.g., pain clinics, orthopedics, surgeons, oncologists, cancer centers, weight loss clinics); unusually large numbers of individuals in the general vicinity of a physician's practice or the pharmacy; and whether the clientele was consistent with the demographics of the area. (Id at 8.)    During the site visit, investigators were required to interview the appropriate personnel and to complete the data collection worksheet. (Id at 7, 9.) Investigators were instructed to use the data collection worksheet as a guide and to be generally observant and particularly watchful for potential indicators of diversion, including: customers exhibiting drug-seeking behaviors; cars full of pharmacy customers; out-of-state license plates in the parking lot; long lines at the pharmacy; customers who appear to be from outside the reasonable drawing area for the facility;    Revised versions of these SOPs were issued in November 2009, April 2012, and June 2012.    18    CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY    CAH_HOUSE-003351 CAH  MDL PRIORPROD HOUSE 0003351     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1964-8  Filed:  07/23/19  23 of 43.  PagelD #: 163479    evidence of illicit drug use around the facility (e.g., used syringes, empty prescription containers); mailing materials or other evidence of operation of an internet pharmacy; high ratio of prescriptions for regulated drugs versus other drugs; high ratio of regulated prescription drug stock to other prescription drug stock; small or non-existent front end (non-prescription) drug stock; and primarily cash transactions for regulated drug prescriptions.27 (See id. at 7-8.) Investigators were expected to request a tour of all areas of the facility and permission to take photographs of the front of the prescription department, the front end non-prescription drug sections, several prescription bays or shelves, the back room, any automation, and the front of the facility from the outside. (Id. at 9-10.) Investigators were also directed to request a recent drug utilization report from the pharmacy, showing the top twenty-five controlled substances by quantity dispensed28 and six to twelve months of usage data by month. (Id. at 10.)    Other important factors included: the volume of controlled substances ordered; the percentage of transactions that did not include some form of third-party payment; the percentage of Schedule II controlled substances dispensed relative to all controlled substances; the percentage of controlled substances dispensed relative to non-controlled substances; and whether the pharmacist seemed to understand his or her responsibility to dispense controlled substances only for legitimate purposes. (Feb. 6 Mone Decl. Tf 21.)    During the report preparation phase, the investigator was directed to analyze the information collected, to formulate a recommendation to the Director of Investigations, and to prepare a final report in the pre-approved memo format. (On-Site Investigations, Dec. 22, 2008, at 11.) At a minimum, the report would indicate whether the pharmacy posed a significant risk of diversion. (Id.) In the usual case, a site visit was to be completed within thirty days of assignment and a final report was to be submitted to the Director of Investigations within ten days of the visit, but priority cases could be assigned shorter time frames. (See id. at 4.)    The SOPs required the Director of Investigations to ""monitor the progress of cases and provide guidance and direction as necessary to develop and move the case to a successful conclusion."" (Id. at 5.) The Director was required to ""conduct a thorough, final review of each case and make a determination whether the case is complete ... ."" (Id at 12.) Initially, the first Director of Investigations, Steve Morse, reviewed every site visit report, but he later required the investigators to rate each customer as a high, medium, or low risk of diversion, and then he reviewed customers that the investigators identified as medium or high risk. If an on-site investigation was conducted in response to a threshold event, Morse, a pharmacist, would usually make the decision whether to adjust the customer's threshold.    Revised SOPs issued in November 2009 included four additional factors: one employee responsible for ordering, monitoring, and invoicing products; a high number of customers compared to their peers; for practitioner offices, whether the practitioner dispensed directly to the public; and a lack of auditing processes surrounding the purchases. (On-Site Investigations, Nov. 5,2009, at 7.)    28         Revised SOPs issued in November 2009 required dmg utilization reports showing all controlled    substances by quantity dispensed or administered.

PagelD #: 163480    c.        Reporting Suspicious Orders    The CSA requires distributors to ""design and operate a system to disclose . . . suspicious orders of controlled substances"" and inform the appropriate DEA Field Division Office of any suspicious orders. 21 C.F.R. � 1301.74(b). According to the � 1301.74(b), ""[s]uspicious orders include orders of unusual size, orders deviating substantially from a normal pattern, and orders of unusual frequency."" 21 C.F.R. � 1301.74(b). The Company issued SOPs and conducted training in December 2008, explaining the obligation to report suspicious orders and providing the definition of suspicious orders set out in C.F.R. � 1301. (Regulatory Notification of Suspicious Orders and/or Suspension of Sales of Scheduled /List 1 Substances (hereinafter, ""Regulatory Notification""), Dec. 22, 2008, at I; see also Joint Legal QRA Meeting, at 5.) The SOPs described the necessary information and provided form memos to be used in reporting suspicious orders to the DEA and State boards of pharmacy. (Regulatory Notification, at 4-8.) The pharmacists in the anti-diversion group determined which orders should be deleted and not filled and which customers to report to the DEA as suspicious based on the language of � 1301.74(b), and their knowledge and expertise.    4.        Training    The Company provided anti-diversion training to distribution center employees, including all personnel with access to controlled substances and their supervisors, as well as the pharmaceutical sales force and any personnel involved in compliance-related functions. (Morford Decl. If 8; Quintero Decl. If 8.) The Company required thousands of employees across a variety of departments29 to take the Anti-Diversion - Know Your Customer training module, which covered such topics as: types of diversion; the Company's approach to combating diversion and the purpose of the anti-diversion measures; reporting suspected violations; screening new customers; monitoring existing customers; investigating suspected diversion; and taking corrective action once diversion was detected. (See Anti-Diversion KYC WebX Training Module, at 8, 18-25, 28, 31, 35-37.) Employees were required to score 100% on the post-training test to earn a certificate of completion. (Anti-Diversion KYC Web-X Training Module, at 5.) The module was administered through the ""MyLearning"" program, which automatically assigned computer-based training to employees based on their job titles, and sent electronic notifications and reminders to employees about required training. Any training not completed by the due date would be included on a past due list and the employee's supervisor would be notified.    In addition to computer-based training, there were also periodic live presentations regarding the anti-diversion system. (See, e.g., Supply Chain Integrity, Michael A. Mone, 2010 (discussing the SOM system and indicators of diversion); Quality and Regulatory Affairs: Overview of Anti-Diversion Program, 2011 (discussing the electronic monitoring system and KYC procedures).)    The departments included Sales (Medical and Pharmaceutical), Operations, Human Resources, Finance, Customer Service, IT, Facilities, and Real Estate.    20    CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY    CAH_HOUSE-003353 CAH  MDL PRIORPROD HOUSE 0003353     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1964-8  Filed:  07/23/19  25 of 43.  PagelD #: 163481    a.         Training of Sales Personnel    In addition to the Anti-Diversion Training Module, the sales force received supplementary training on the Know Your Customer procedures and the electronic monitoring system. (See, e.g., Anti-Diversion: It's Everyone's Responsibility, Cardinal Health National Sales Conference Presentation, Michael A. Mone, 2008, at 3-5.) The salespeople were also trained on indicia of diversion, such as long lines in the pharmacy, out-of-state customers, and large percentages of controlled substance sales that were not reimbursed by insurance or other health programs. (Giacomin Decl. ffll 9-10.) A ready reference document was provided to help salespeople identify signs of diversion.    The sales force received anti-diversion training from QRA and from their own dedicated training staff. Mone also spoke each year at the annual sales conference on compliance issues and trends in diversion. (Giacomin Decl. If 9.)    b.         Training of QRA Personnel    Pharmacists, investigators, analysts, distribution center employees, and compliance officers all received anti-diversion training focused on their specific job functions, Each of the pharmacists was trained on the Company's anti-diversion policies and procedures, including the procedures for reviewing customers and threshold events. Pharmacists also received ""on-the-job"" training focused on monitoring existing customers for signs of diversion.    The investigators received one-on-one training with the Director of Investigations when they started with Cardinal Health. Because the investigators already had investigative experience, the training focused on pharmacies and drugs, including warning signs to look for when evaluating a pharmacy, as well as different types of drugs and standard nomenclature. The investigators were also trained on the Company's anti-diversion system and procedures, and on setting the proper ""tone"" during site visits. In addition, the investigators and pharmacists attended conferences of the National Association of Drug Diversion Investigators (""NADDI""), the National Association of State Controlled Substances Authorities, and the American Pharmacists Association. (Feb. 6 Mone Decl. If 5.)    Analysts received training that included how to interpret and verify information provided by customers and how to research and gather information on customers. Analysts also received instruction on the types of information that should be brought to the attention of their superiors in QRA.    Distribution center employees underwent extensive training on anti-diversion and other compliance-related issues. Employees in the cage and vault received additional anti-diversion training. All distribution center employees were provided with a wallet card listing indicators of diversion. Compliance officers were responsible for administering training on any relevant changes to the procedures, and would conduct periodic audits to ensure that all personnel had undergone the required training.    New compliance officers typically underwent week-long training at the Company's corporate offices, which included training on the anti-diversion policies and procedures.    21    CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY    CAH_HOUSE-003354 CAH  MDL PRIORPROD HOUSE 0003354     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1964-8  Filed:  07/23/19  26 of 43.  PagelD #: 163482    Compliance officers also attended annual meetings at the corporate offices, where they received additional training on the Company's anti-diversion system. The topics discussed at the annual meetings included the relevant regulations and the obligation to report suspicious orders, the implementation of the electronic monitoring system and changes to the system, sample threshold event exercises, and trends in diversion, among others. (See, e.g., DEA & Boards of Pharmacy Priorities, QRA Compliance Officer Annual Meeting, Michael A. Mone and Martha Russell, June 9, 2010; QRA - SOM Update 2011, Michael A. Mone, June 29, 2011.)    5.        DEA Inspections    As part of the 2008 MOA, the DEA visited Cardinal Health headquarters in Dublin in early 2009 to review the new anti-diversion system, and conducted ""compliance reviews"" at five distribution centers. (See 2008 MOA at 5-6.) The DEA indicated initially that it found the controls in place at one distribution center, the facility located in Valencia, California, to be ""unsatisfactory,"" but the Company rectified the issues and the DEA did not bring any formal proceedings regarding the facility. (See Letter from Larry P. Cote to Mark Hartman, Mar. 16, 2009; Letter from Jodi L. Avergun to Wendy H. Goggin and Lany P. Cote, Mar. 25, 2009; see also Chief Compliance Officer Q3 Update, Craig Morford, May 2009, at 4.)    The DEA also conducted routine cyclical inspections at Cardinal Health distribution centers in the years following the 2008 MOA. The DEA did not issue any negative findings regarding the anti-diversion measures in place at any distribution center in the years leading up to the October 25, 2011 Warrant for Inspection for the Lakeland facility.30 In general, notes taken by Cardinal Health personnel who were present during the inspections indicated that the DEA inspectors were satisfied with the anti-diversion procedures that they reviewed. (See generally, DEA Cyclical Inspection Notes.) These notes were forwarded to management within QRA, and the Company informed the Board that the inspections had been ""successful"" and that there were no negative findings regarding the SOM system. See infra Part V.    For example, during the May 2009 inspection of the Aurora, Illinois facility, Cardinal Health personnel reviewed the SOM system with the DEA inspectors and the list of ""red flags"" used when reviewing orders. (DEA Cyclical Inspection Notes, at 3.) Notes taken by a Cardinal Health employee who was present during the inspection state that the DEA inspectors told facility personnel during the exit interview to ""keep up the good work."" (Id.) In an email to a Vice President of QRA regarding the final day of the inspection, a regional director who was present for the inspection noted, ""[w]e heard from them during the closeout many many times 'We have nothing for you, you guys are perfect.'"" (Id. at 2.) Similarly, during the August 2010 inspection of the Knoxville, Tennessee facility, during which the facility's compliance officer    In September 2009, the DEA conducted a cyclical inspection of the distribution center located in Hudson, Wisconsin. (See generally, DEA Cyclical Inspection Notes, at 33-37.) The inspectors commented during the inspection that certain orders that the Hudson facility filled should have been reported as suspicious, but there were no negative findings issued and, according to the notes from the inspection, the inspectors indicated that they were generally satisfied with the inspection. Id. at 37.    In Fall 2011, the DEA sent letters of admonition regarding certain operational compliance issues for three facilities, relating specifically to record keeping and die fact that one facility shipped controlled substances to a customer's new address that had not yet been registered with the DEA.    22    CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY    CAH_HOUSE-003355 CAH  MDL PRIORPROD HOUSE 0003355     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1964-8  Filed:  07/23/19  27 of 43.  PagelD #: 163483    gave a short explanation of the Company's ""identify, block, report"" mantra for suspicious orders, one of the inspectors remarked during the exit interview, '""everything is peachy.'"" (Id. at 29.)    In May 2010, two DEA field inspectors conducted a two-day inspection of the Company's Lakeland, Florida distribution center.31 (Id. at 18.) The inspection included a review of the facility's security system, ARCOS/CSOS32 protocol, specific customer order history, inventory reports and records, and anti-diversion training. (Id. at 18-19.) The distribution center personnel also gave a presentation to the DEA inspectors on the SOM system, which lasted over an hour and included a power point presentation. (DEA Cyclical Inspection Notes, at 18; Butler Decl. If 19.) The DEA inspectors stated that they needed to see the SOM system in action because a major purpose of the inspection was ""to ensure that Cardinal Health was doing what they had agreed to in the [2008] MOA and that the process was working the way they said it did."" (Id) The inspectors asked to review the SOM process from account set-up to deactivation, including examples of all documents and forms used during the process, for seven specific customers. (Id at 19.)    During the review of the seven customers, facility personnel provided the inspectors with the Schedule II and Schedule III controlled substance sales for those customers for a two-month period, noting that the Company had previously discontinued controlled shipments to one of the registrants in September 2009. (Id. at 19.) The DEA inspector reviewed the documentation for this particular customer, continually noting that reviewing the specific records and documentation would verify whether the SOM system was working. (Id.) According to the notes recorded by a Company employee, the DEA inspector indicated that ""[t]he documentation reviewed verified the process was working as presented."" (Id.)    The inspection also reviewed the facility personnel's knowledge of the ARCOS and CSOS systems. (Id at 18.) Although the ARCOS/CSOS portion of the inspection was a new component not previously reviewed by DEA, the notes indicate that the inspectors were impressed with the employees' knowledge of the relevant process. (Id at 18, 20.)    During the final portion of the inspection, the inspectors asked the distribution center Compliance Officer about the various training efforts for employees. (Id. at 20.) The Compliance Officer noted that everyone who worked in the facility was required to undergo training that included ""DEA general awareness, anti-diversion, and suspicious order monitoring,"" and that employees who had unsupervised access to the cage/vault area were required to complete Cage/Vault certification training and score 100% on the post-training test.    The DEA also visited the Lakeland facility in early 2009, in accordance with the 2008 MOA. Personnel who were present for the inspection, including a Regional Director of Quality, reported that the DEA agents complimented the facility's systems, and that no changes needed to be made in response to the inspection.    21        ARCOS stands for Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System and is a system used    by DEA and other governmental authorities to gather information from drug manufacturers and distributors regarding inventories, acquisitions, and dispositions of controlled substances. (See http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/arcos/faq.htm.) CSOS stands for Controlled Substance Ordering System and is a DEA program that allows for electronic ordering of controlled substances. (See http: //www .deaecom .go v/about .html.)    23    CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY    CAH_HOUSE-003356 CAH  MDL PRIORPROD HOUSE 0003356     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1964-8  Filed:  07/23/19  28 of 43.  PagelD #: 163484    (Id.) The DEA inspector seemed surprised and impressed to learn that a 100% score was required. (Id.; Butler Decl. yf 18.) The DEA inspector also seemed surprised to learn that there was mandatory annual follow-up training on the cage/vault certification, SOM system, anti-diversion and DEA general awareness. (Id.)    At the end of the inspection, the DEA inspectors advised facility personnel that their inspection resulted in no negative findings or comments and that the Lakeland facility was in compliance with DEA regulations and the terms of the MOA. (Butler Decl. If 22; DEA Cyclical Inspection Notes, at 20.) The inspectors indicated that the SOM presentation was ""great"" and that they were able to verify actual compliance by tracing customer activity through account set up to deactivation. (DEA Cyclical Inspection Notes, at 20.)    In July 2009, the DEA conducted an inspection of a distribution center in Peabody, Massachusetts. The inspector suggested to facility personnel, and then to Mone via telephone, that Cardinal Health should conduct due diligence on chain stores in the same manner as it did for independent pharmacies, including by conducting site visits of chain stores.33 (See-Declaration of Joseph Rannazzisi, Cardinal Health, Inc. v. Holder, No. 12-185 (D.D.C. Feb. 10, 2012), If 59.) Soon after, Mone spoke with Barbara Boockholdt, Chief of the Regulatory Section in the DEA's Office of Diversion Control, and relayed the conversation with the inspector and reminded Boockholdt that Cardinal Health coordinated with the chain pharmacies' corporate loss prevention departments regarding orders of concern and did not conduct on-site investigations of chain pharmacies.34 (Apr. 23 Mone Decl. \ 8.) Based on the fact that Boockholdt made no disagreement and on his prior experiences with Boockholdt, Mone concluded that the DEA did not object to Cardinal Health's procedures for chain pharmacies. (Declaration of Michael A. Mone Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. � 1746, Cardinal Health, Inc. v. Holder, No. 12-185 (D.D.C. Feb. 20, 2012) (""Feb. 20 Mone Decl""), If 15.) In November 2009, Boockholdt indicated that Cardinal Health should exercise the same level of oversight with respect to chain pharmacies as it did with independent pharmacies. (Apr. 23 Mone Decl. \ 9.) The Company explained its method of coordinating its diligence efforts with the chains' loss prevention teams in addition to conducting its own review of the ordering data for chain stores, and there were no further comments from the DEA about the issue. (Id)    The inspector also commented on the feet that records for certain chain pharmacies were not available at the facility, and Mone explained to the inspector that such records are maintained at Cardinal Health's headquarters in Dublin. (Supplemental Declaration of Michael A. Mone Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. � 1746, Cardinal Health, Inc. v. Holder, No. 12-185 (D.D.C. Feb. 12, 2012) (""Feb. 12 Mone Deck""), 1 7.)    34        Mone had previously discussed this with Boockholdt during the DEA visit to Cardinal Health's    headquarters in Dublin in early 2009, and neither Boockholdt nor any of the other DEA personnel present during that meeting raised any objections to the Company's procedures for chain pharmacies.

PagelD #: 163485    V.        COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE BOARD AND AUDIT COMMITTEE REGARDING ANTI-DIVERSION MEASURES    The Board and Audit Committee   received regular and extensive updates regarding the anti-diversion system. Craig Morford provided annual compliance reports to the Board each August and annual regulatory reports to the Audit Committee (or the full Board) each November. Morford also provided the Audit Committee and the Board with updates on compliance and regulatory issues as warranted, either at the quarterly meetings or via communications between the quarterly meetings.36 The Board was also provided with updates as part of the Company's Enterprise Risk Management system, which informs the Board about risks the Company is facing, including enforcement actions and compliance issues. (See, e.g., Enterprise Risk List, May 2011.) In addition, Morford updated the Audit Committee and the Board on an as-needed basis.37 The following is a summary of some specific communications and materials relating to the Company's anti-diversion measures that were provided to the Board and the Audit Committee between 2007 and 2012.    In August 2007, Walsh provided the Board with a presentation that highlighted the creation of the anti-diversion policies. (Annual Program Review, Ethics and Compliance, Dan Walsh, Aug. 2007, at 4.) Two months later, the Audit Committee received a report listing issues and initiatives for 2007, including reengineering systems and updating practices for controlling Schedule 3 drugs. (Quality & Regulatory Affairs Update, Gary Dolch, Oct. 2007, at 6.) In November 2007, the Audit Committee was informed that the Company had developed a web-based training module and administered anti-diversion training to more than 2,300 employees. (Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer Update, Daniel J. Walsh, Nov. 6, 2007, at 3, 6.)    In January 2008, the Audit Committee learned that the Company engaged ""outside counsel and their retained anti-diversion experts to conduct an expansive review of the historic and current anti-diversion practices at all of the Company's distribution facilities."" (Report on Lawsuits and Claims, Ivan K. Fong, Jan. 18, 2008, at 7.) In addition, the Audit Committee learned that the Company had accelerated the due diligence being performed on customers that were top purchasers of certain controlled substances, established ordering limitations for those substances, and began implementation of a computerized order monitoring and control system to assist in preventing diversion. (Id)    In advance of the January 31,2008 Board meeting, the Board was informed that in reacting to the ""flurry of actions from the DEA,"" the Company took immediate action against a    The Audit Committee is appointed by the Board to assist the Board with, among other things, the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and the Company's processes for assessing and managing risk. (See Audit Committee Charter, Nov. 2, 2012, at 1.) The Audit Committee meets as often as it deems necessary, but is required to meet at least once per quarter. (Id)    36          Before Morford joined the Company, the Board received compliance and regulatory updates from his predecessor, Daniel Walsh, as well as Ivan Fong, the Chief Legal Officer and Secretary, and Jeff Henderson, the Chief Financial Officer.    37         When a new director joined the Board, Morford and Steve Falk, General Counsel, would provide that director with an overview of the Company's anti-diversion program. Gilberto Quintero also provided updates to the Board, and provided the Board with an overview of the entire anti-diversion system.    25    CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY    CAHJHOUSE-003358 CAH  MDL PRIORPROD HOUSE 0003358     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1964-8  Filed:  07/23/19 30 of 43.  PagelD #: 163486    number of pharmacies that were flagged as suspicious based on their ordering patterns or other factors. (Controlled Substance Diversion Update, Jeff Henderson, Jan. 23, 2008, at 2.) As a result, the Company ceased distributing to a number of suspicious pharmacies, but also temporarily cut off a few customers that further investigation showed to be potentially legitimate. (Id) The Board was also provided with a detailed action plan for the Company's key anti-diversion measures in the form of a seven-page chart listing the tasks to be completed, the progress thus far, and target completion dates. (Id) The progress included changes to the anti-diversion personnel, processes, and systems, including: hiring additional anti-diversion personnel and reorganizing the anti-diversion group; improving the reviewing and reporting structure; revising certain procedures relating to investigations, communication between departments, and monitoring; and developing enhanced anti-diversion training. (Id)    The Board was also provided with a presentation listing the key anti-diversion measures that had been implemented or were in the process of being implemented. (DEA Update, Jeff Henderson and Ivan Fong, Jan. 31,2008, at 4.) These measures included the development of heightened criteria for new customers, development and implementation of enhanced training, organizational realignment and hiring of new anti-diversion personnel, conducting investigations on hundreds of existing customers and utilizing outside investigators as needed, launching the IT solution for order review, initiating independent, third-party review, suspending over sixty accounts, implementing order limits for certain drugs, and revising the sales compensation structure to encourage salespeople to report signs of diversion. (Id) The Company also indicated that it was focused on responding promptly to any indicators of diversion (""red flags"") and suspicious orders, and maintaining a dialogue with the DEA regarding the new IT system. (Id. at 5)    In February 2008, Fong and Henderson provided an update to the Board highlighting key changes in the anti-diversion system that had already been implemented based on recommendations of outside counsel and other anti-diversion consultants, in the areas of personnel, processes, training, and systems. (Anti-Diversion Update, Ivan K. Fong and Jeff Henderson, Feb. 22, 2008, at 3-4.) These changes included hiring new anti-diversion leadership, reviewing and replacing QRA personnel at distribution centers, and hiring a team of investigators. (Id. at 3.) In addition, the Company established procedures to review threshold events, approve new customers, and improve communications between the Sales and QRA teams. (Id. at 3.) As a result of these new processes, the Company terminated over 110 customers and rejected six potential new customers. (Id. at 4.) Further, the Company initiated comprehensive and ongoing anti-diversion training and continued to roll out the electronic order monitoring system, (Id. at 3-4.)    During the May 7, 2008 Board meeting, Fong and Henderson provided the Board with another update describing the progress on key anti-diversion action items, which included the hiring of a Chief Compliance Officer, a Senior Vice President of Supply Chain Integrity, a Vice President, two directors, six investigators, and twenty-four field QRA compliance managers, as well as the implementation of new procedures, training, and an enhanced electronic monitoring system for retail independent pharmacies.

PagelD #: 163487    The May 2008 presentation also described the Company's newly-established standardized criteria to identify excessive purchases, and its enhanced process for investigating suspicious orders. (Anti-Diversion Update, Ivan K. Fong and Jeff Henderson, May 7, 2008, at 5.) As part of these improvements, the Company conducted site visits of 266 customers, and twenty-one distribution centers, and implemented recommendations made by outside counsel for each. (Id) Further, the Company stopped selling to, and reported, 115 customers. (Id) The Company also completed the first two phases of implementing the electronic monitoring system, which involved refining the thresholds for retail independent pharmacies, and rolling out the remaining classes of trade. (Id. at 6.) As a result, from January through March, the Company blocked and investigated 2,760 excessive orders. (Id. at 6.) Other improvements to the Company's anti-diversion measures included: the development of educational materials for employees regarding diversion and controlled substance abuse; the establishment of more focused communications between sales, operations, and QRA; the performance of distribution center QRA process and procedural audits relating to controlled substance handling and security; review of the relevant SOPs with QRA personnel; training of 1,700 employees at over 100 different training events; and development and implementation of an on-going training curriculum. (Id. at 5.) The presentation included a list of items to be completed in the short-term, which included upgrading the SOPs, completing full implementation of the electronic monitoring system, fully training personnel on anti-diversion requirements and KYC policies, and enhancing the distribution center level security and in-transit processes. (Id. at 2.)    Shortly after the May 2008 Board meeting, Fong informed the Board about an investigation by the Ohio Board of Pharmacy, based on allegations that the Company's distribution center in Findlay, Ohio made suspicious sales to a pharmacy in Dublin from December 2006 through March 2007. (Email from Ivan Fong to Cardinal Health Directors, May 29, 2008.) Fong relayed that anti-diversion personnel noticed the increased orders of controlled substances for that pharmacy in February 2007. (Id) The Company conducted a site visit in March 2007 and terminated the customer in April 2007, a few days after the Ohio Board of Pharmacy suspended the customer's license. (Id) Fong communicated the belief that the current anti-diversion controls would have caught the suspicious behavior of this pharmacy much sooner. (Id)    In advance of the August 5, 2008 Audit Committee meeting, Morford provided the Audit Committee with his first Chief Compliance Officer Update, which noted that the role of Chief Compliance Officer had been greatly expanded and described the Company's current procedures for detecting suspicious orders of controlled substances. (Chief Compliance Officer Update, Craig Morford, Aug. 2008, at 2, 10.) This report also noted key accomplishments, including: establishment and implementation of the electronic monitoring system; establishment of the KYC program; KYC training administered to 2,500 employees; and the creation of thirty-eight new anti-diversion positions. (Id. at 10.) Finally, the report noted that key priorities for 2009 included rolling out the electronic monitoring system to the remaining classes of trade, finalizing a settlement agreement with the DEA, and bringing the suspended facilities back on line. (Id. at 11.)    Morford also provided a Chief Compliance Officer report to the entire Board, which included a review of anti-diversion updates. (Chief Compliance Officer Report, Craig Morford, Aug. 2008.) Among the changes discussed were the expansion of Morford's role as Chief    27    CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY    CAH_HOUSE-003360 CAH  MDL PRIORPROD HOUSE 0003360     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1964-8  Filed:  07/23/19 32 of 43.  PagelD #: 163488    Compliance Officer, and business leaders throughout the Company being given the ""duty, responsibility, and accountability"" for making appropriate decisions regarding quality and compliance. (Id. at 6.) The Board was also updated on the Company's progress in achieving its goal of establishing a ""premier system for identifying, reporting, and blocking suspicious controlled pharmaceutical orders."" (Id. at 5.) Finally, Morford noted that expanding the electronic monitoring system and establishing sufficient systems to comply with the forthcoming settlement with the DEA were top priorities. (Id. at 10.)    In November 2008, Morford informed the Audit Committee that the Company had reached a settlement with the DEA, and explained the Company's obligations under the settlement agreement. (Chief Compliance Officer Ql Update, Craig Morford, Nov. 2008, at 9, 20-21.) The Audit Committee also learned that training on the KYC procedures and the implementation of those procedures was complete and, as of the end of October 2008, the electronic monitoring system covered 80% of DEA registrants. (Id. at 9.) The Company expected to complete the roll out of the electronic monitoring system across the remaining classes of trade by December 2008. (Id) Morford also informed the Audit Committee that DEA compliance inspections were scheduled to begin in January 2009. (Id) To prepare for these inspections, the Company planned to revise and develop SOPs to improve the existing supply chain integrity process. (Id) The Audit Committee was also informed that anti-diversion training was in progress on distribution center and sales SOPs, KYC procedures, and the electronic monitoring system. (Id. at 19.) Fong also discussed the DEA settlement and the Company's anti-diversion measures at the next day's Board meeting.    The Audit Committee received another update on the anti-diversion measures in February 2009, including that the electronic monitoring program was rolled out to the additional classes beyond retail independent pharmacies, and that the program was favorably received by the DEA on December 18, 2008. (Chief Compliance Officer Q2 Update, Craig Morford, Feb. 2009, at 12.) The materials also stated that the distribution centers that had been suspended in 2007 and 2008 were back online and that, as part of the settlement with the DEA, the DEA planned to conduct compliance reviews at the Company's corporate headquarters and at several facilities. (Id)    The Audit Committee received an update regarding the DEA inspections in advance of its May 2009 meeting. (Report on Lawsuits and Claims, Stephen T. Falk, Apr. 23, 2009, at 10.) The Audit Committee was informed that in January and February 2009, the DEA had visited the Company's Dublin headquarters and performed compliance reviews of five distribution centers. (Id; see also Chief Compliance Officer Q3 Update, Craig Morford, May 2009, at 4.) Further, the Audit Committee was informed that on March 16,2009, the DEA notified the Company that it considered one of those distribution centers, the facility located in Valencia, California, to be ""unsatisfactory,"" and that the Company met with the DEA to address those concerns on March 19 and submitted a written response to the DEA on March 25. (Report on Lawsuits and Claims, Steve Falk, Apr. 23, 2009, at 10.) In May 2009, Morford informed the Audit Committee that the Company received favorable oral feedback regarding the Valencia facility issues. (Chief Compliance Officer Q3 Update, Craig Morford, May 2009, at 4.)    In August 2009, Morford informed the Audit Committee that the Company completed data reviews for all customers and all necessary customer investigations, and achieved ""superior    28    CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY    CAH_HOUSE-003361 CAH  MDL PRIORPROD HOUSE 0003361     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1964-8  Filed:  07/23/19 33 of 43.  PagelD #: 163489    results"" on routine DEA cyclical inspections of five distribution centers. (Chief Compliance Officer Q4 Update, Craig Morford, Aug. 2009, at 4.) Morford also provided an update on the Company's anti-diversion efforts to the entire Board. (Annual Compliance Program Review, Craig Morford, Aug. 2009.) The update stated that the Company had ""[d]esigned and implemented an effective Suspicious Order Monitoring Program across all classes of trade,"" successfully completed routine DEA cyclical inspections of five distribution centers with ""superior ratings,"" and developed regulatory operations SOPs. (Id. at 5.) The Board was also informed that 3,600 employees underwent anti-diversion training during fiscal year 2009.38 (Id. at 22.) In October 2009, the Audit Committee received a compliance update noting that the routine DEA cyclical reviews of distribution centers to date had ""gone well."" (Quarterly Compliance Program Update, Craig Morford, Oct. 27, 2009, attaching Compliance: Quarterly Compliance Program Update, Craig Morford, Nov. 2009, at 2.)    In October 2010, Morford provided the Audit Committee with an Annual Quality and Regulatory Report, which included an overview of the then-current regulatory environment. (2010 Annual Quality and Regulatory Report, Craig Morford, Oct. 2010, at 4-5.) Morford noted that the DEA had increased its focus in ""high risk"" states, including Florida. (Id. at 4.) The expected areas of focus for the DEA were dispensing pain clinics, selected pharmacies servicing non-dispensing pain clinics, and distributors servicing ""bad"" pharmacies. (Id) In response to the increased focus in Florida, a task force was assigned to evaluate all Florida customers, and work with customers to address potential diversion risks and/or terminate customers that posed too high of a risk. (Id. at 8.) During the ensuing months, the Company expected the DEA to focus on the Company's operational controls and the overall effectiveness of its anti-diversion program. (Id. at 4.) The report also noted that the DEA had conducted twenty-five routine cyclical inspections over the previous twelve months, which resulted in no ""observations,"" or negative findings. (Id. at 7, 10.)    Morford provided the full Board with a review of the main anti-diversion risks in advance of the November 2010 Board meeting. (Review of Key Risks - November Board Meeting, Craig Morford, Oct. 26, 2010, attaching Enterprise Risk List, Nov. 2010.) He also noted the ways those risks were being mitigated, including: the electronic monitoring program, which was overseen by experienced pharmacists; the KYC procedures; the advanced analytics driving focused customer visits; the focused approach in high risk areas, such as Florida; the plans for business continuity; and the continued monitoring of DEA meetings. (Enterprise Risk List, Nov. 2010, at 1, 7.)    On July 26, 2011, Morford sent a memorandum to the Board regarding key initiatives and accomplishments in fiscal year 2011. (Pre-read for Key Risks and Annual Compliance Review, Craig Morford, July 26, 2011.) Among other things, the memorandum described the enhanced electronic monitoring system, which decreased ""false positives,"" i.e., legitimate customers or    The training efforts continued, and in July 2010, the Directors were informed that anti-diversion training had been administered to many additional employees. (Annual Update - FY '10, Ethics and Compliance Program, Craig Morford, July 27,2010, at 3.)    29    CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY    CAH_HOUSE-003362 CAH  MDL PRIORPROD HOUSE 0003362     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1964-8  Filed:  07/23/19 34 of 43.  PagelD #: 163490    orders that were flagged as suspicious.     (Id. at 5.) On the same day, the Board also received a memorandum from Morford and Falk regarding a customer who wanted to do business with Cardinal Health and was upset that the Company had refused, based on a determination that the pharmacy posed a high risk of diversion. (Communication from Pharmacy Owner, Craig Morford and Steve Falk, July 26, 2011.)    In advance of the November 2011 Board meeting, Morford and Quintero provided an update on regulatory matters, including the regulatory environment and increased focus on distributors. (Annual Quality and Regulatory Report, Craig S. Morford, Oct. 25, 2011, at 2-3.) The update stated that the DEA conducted twelve routine cyclical inspections during fiscal years 2011 and 2012, which resulted in four ""observations,"" or negative findings.40 (Id. at 5.) The update also identified the risk of the DEA's aggressive posture on anti-diversion and the Company's major mitigating factors, including: the development of an advanced analytics program to better predict diversion; the formation of SWAT teams to evaluate high risk regions, including Florida; the hiring of former DEA senior counsel as a consultant to the Company; and close coordination of senior business leaders in managing risk. (Id. at 6.) Further, the update discussed key accomplishments in the Company's anti-diversion program during fiscal year 2011. (Id. at 10.) In particular, the Company underwent five successful DEA cyclical inspections and the DEA had not issued any findings regarding the SOM system for the previous three years. (Id.) The update also stated that the Company had reduced impact to legitimate customers by increasing accuracy through advanced analytics, including the introduction of a new model to predict the probability of a customer engaging in diversion. (Id) As a result, the incidence of flagged events was reduced by 2,509, or 37%, from fiscal year 2010 to 2011. (Id) Additionally, during fiscal year 2011, forty-seven suspicious orders were identified and reported to the DEA, thirty-six customers were restricted from purchasing controlled substances, and eighteen potential new customers were denied from purchasing controlled substances. (Id. at 10-11.)    A separate report prepared for the November 2011 Board meeting further discussed the regulatory risks posed by the DEA's aggressive posture and noted that the Lakeland distribution center received an investigational warrant on Oct. 26, 2011. (See generally, 2011 Annual Quality and Regulatory Report - Pharma Segment, Craig Morford and Gilberto Quintero, Nov. 2, 2011.) The report included a summary of the Company's anti-diversion initiatives over the last four years, including the use of statistics and advanced analytics to help make determinations regarding customer risk, noting that the Company had made significant monetary investments in the new system and engaged many additional employees. (Id. at 5.) The report noted that since 2007, over 300 pharmacies had been terminated and reported to the DEA as suspicious, and fifty of those were in Florida.41 (Id)    The prior system resulted in many more ""false positives"" and legitimate customers being terminated as diversion risks. The Company implemented changes in 2011 that refined the electronic monitoring system and increased its accuracy.    40         See supra note 30 (discussing the letters of admonition addressing operational compliance concerns).    41          In addition to the updates discussed above, the Board and Audit Committee also received updates regarding compliance issues and the status of the Company's anti-diversion efforts at the following    30    CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY    CAH_HOUSE-003363 CAH  MDL PRIORPROD HOUSE 0003363     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1964-8  Filed:  07/23/19 35 of 43.  PagelD #: 163491    VI.      THE 2012 ISO    A.       The Events Surrounding the 2012 ISO    The 2012 ISO asserted that from January 2008 through December 2011, Cardinal Health sold excessive amounts of oxycodone to its top four retail pharmacy customers, all located in Florida and serviced by the Company's Lakeland facility: two CVS stores, CVS/Pharmacy #00219 (""CVS 219"") and CVS/Pharmacy #05195 (""CVS 5195""), and two independent retail pharmacies, Caremed Health Corporation (""Caremed"") and Gulf Coast Pharmacy (""Gulf Coast"").42 (2012 ISO at 2.) The 2012 ISO alleged further that Cardinal Health ""failed to conduct meaningful due diligence"" of its retail pharmacy customers, including its chain customers, and ""failed to detect and report suspicious orders of oxycodone products by its pharmacy customers.""    (Id. at 3.)    The Company's electronic monitoring system flagged the four pharmacies at issue in the 2012 ISO, and the anti-diversion group reviewed the pharmacies' orders and communicated with the pharmacists at Caremed and Gulf Coast and with the CVS loss prevention department. Cardinal Health ceased distributing controlled substances to Caremed and Gulf Coast months before the 2012 ISO, and the quantity of oxycodone being shipped to CVS 219 and CVS 5195 had diminished significantly by that time.    With respect to Gulf Coast, Company personnel conducted frequent site visits, including in August 2008, April 2009, December 2009, October 2010, andFebruary 2011. (Apr. 13 Mone Decl. lj 59.) Gulf Coast was located in a hospital medical complex and served emergency room patients, four pain management clinics, and three nursing homes and assisted living facilities, making the high volumes seem reasonable. (Feb. 6 Mone Decl. 143 ,b.) Further, in 2009, the hospital added over 300 beds. (Feb. 6 Mone Decl. \ 43.c.) The pharmacy provided drug utilization reports for December 2009 and July 2010, which the anti-diversion group reviewed and concluded were consistent with legitimate use. (Feb. 6 Mone Decl. If 43.e.)    meetings: the May 6, 2009 Board meeting; the January 31 and February 1, 2011 Audit Committee meeting; the May 3, 2011 Audit Committee Meeting; and the October 25, 2011 Audit Committee Meeting.    42          According to the ISO, the amount of oxycodone that the Company was distributing to these pharmacies ""well exceeded"" the average amount of oxycodone that the Company's Florida retail pharmacies were receiving. (2012 ISO at 2.) The affidavit in support of the Administrative Inspection Warrant served on the Lakeland facility on October 26, 2011 also relied heavily on volume and comparison of sales averages. (See Affidavit for Administrative Inspection Warrant, Oct. 25, 2011, yflf 5-6.) However, according to the DEA's own data, the average number of dosage units of oxycodone distributed from the Company's Lakeland facility to each of Cardinal Health's Florida pharmacy customers was far less than the average amount purchased by Florida pharmacies from late 2008 through 2011. (See Plaintiff Cardinal Health, Inc.'s Notice of Submission Pursuant to the Court's Order of February 16, 2012, at 6, Cardinal Health, Inc. v. Holder, No. 12-185 (D.D.C. Feb. 20,2012) (including chart titled ""Oxycodone Dosage Units Purchased by Pharmacies"").)    43          This section provides a brief summary of the events at issue in the 2012 ISO. A more detailed review of the DEA's allegations can be found in the Leonhart Declaration.    31    CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY    CAH_HOUSE-003364 CAH  MDL PRIORPROD HOUSE 0003364     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1964-8  Filed:  07/23/19 36 of 43.  PagelD #: 163492    During an investigation in April 2009, the investigator, Vincent Moellering, learned some information about Gulf Coast from one of its competitors that caused him to question the pharmacy's orders. (See Feb. 6 Mone Decl. If 43.a.) Although Moellering could not substantiate the information, and did not observe any other indicia of diversion, he called a local DEA agent and relayed the information. (Memorandum from Vincent Moellering to File re: Gulf Coast Medical Pharmacy, May 7, 2009, at 6.) Moellering did not hear back from the agent after that conversation. (Apr. 13 Mone Decl. If 64.) The following year, after another site visit, Moellering rated Gulf Coast as a ""high risk,"" and requested permission to contact the DEA regarding the pharmacy, because he was not ""convinced that the owner [was] being forthright about his customer's [sic] origin or residence."" (Report of Investigation re: Gulf Coast Medical Pharmacy, Vincent Moellering, Oct. 13, 2010, at 3; Apr. 13 Mone Decl. K 64.) Mone told Moellering that the DEA did not have information regarding the addresses of the pharmacy's patients. (Apr. 13 Mone Decl. If 64.) Moellering then contacted the pharmacy and requested a list of all physicians prescribing C2 - C5 drugs, and received a list of physicians in response. (Memorandum from Vince Moellering to File re: Gulf Coast Medical Pharmacy, Nov. 3, 2010.) Steve Morse, the Director of Investigations, determined that the information showed that ""[t]he primary prescribers identified by the pharmacy owner [were] local, one exception being an orthopedic surgeon,"" and thus rated the pharmacy as a ""medium risk."" (Addendum to Report of Investigation dated 10/13/10 Gulf Coast Medical Pharmacy, Steve Morse, Nov. 9, 2010.)    In February 2011, Morse conducted a follow-up site visit of Gulf Coast and again rated the pharmacy as a ""medium risk."" (Report of Investigation re: Gulf Coast Medical Pharmacy, Steve Morse, Mar. 24, 2011.) However, in Fall 2011, Mallinckrodt, an oxycodone manufacturer, provided Cardinal Health with information indicating that Gulf Coast was purchasing oxycodone from other wholesalers in addition to Cardinal Health. (Apr. 13 Mone Decl. Tf 69.) In addition, Gulf Coast was unable to verify its claim that the local Sheriffs Office supported the consolidation of prescriptions from four nearby health facilities through Gulf Coast,   (Id. If 70.) As a result, the Company terminated Gulf Coast on October 5, 2011. (See Feb. 6 Mone Decl. U 43.f.)    The Company also conducted site visits and obtained drug usage reports for Caremed. (Feb. 6 Mone Decl. 144.) Caremed was located in a community health center with over one hundred doctors' offices, and served a sizeable elderly population. (Feb. 6 Mone Decl. \ 44.a.) Health centers typically offer varied treatment, including pain management. Caremed experienced threshold events in February and March 2010. (Apr. 13 Mone Decl. \T 52.) Morse communicated with Caremed's pharmacist, who explained that the pharmacy was experiencing growth due to a number of factors and provided a drug dispensing report. (Apr, 13 Mone Decl. If 52.) Morse raised the threshold for Caremed in response. (Apr. 13 Mone Decl. H 52.) In May 2010, an investigator performed a site visit of Caremed and concluded that the pharmacy posed a low risk of diversion because the significant elderly population in the surrounding area justified the volume of oxycodone prescriptions. (Apr. 13 Mone Decl. U 53.) The pharmacy's monthly purchases of oxycodone increased between June and December 2010, and the Company sent an investigator to the pharmacy in January 2011. (Feb. 6 Mone Decl. 144.b.) The investigator again concluded that the pharmacy posed a low risk of diversion, based in part on the relatively low percentage of prescriptions that were paid for in cash. (Apr. 13 Mone Decl. If 54.) However, Caremed again prompted concern in September 2011, when the drug utilization report showed a significant increase in the monthly prescriptions for oxycodone. (Feb. 6 Mone Decl. f    32    CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY    CAH_HOUSE-003365 CAH  MDL PRIORPROD HOUSE 0003365     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1964-8  Filed:  07/23/19 37 of 43.  PagelD #: 163493    44.b.) When Moellering visited the store in September 2011, he learned that the physicians who were writing the prescriptions at issue were not located at the health center, and the Company thus terminated Caremed as a customer on September 26, 2011. (See Feb. 6 Mone Decl. If 44.c.)    With respect to the CVS stores at issue in the 2012 ISO, the electronic monitoring system identified oxycodone ordering patterns for these stores that required explanation in late Summer and early Fall 2010. (Apr. 13 Mone Decl. If 73.) In August 2010, Mone met with the Company's primary contact at CVS, Brian Whalen, about certain CVS stores that required investigation, including CVS 219. (Quintero Decl. If 14; Apr. 13 Mone Decl. If 73.) In September 2010, CVS informed the Company that their Loss Prevention team had reviewed the stores and had not uncovered any issues, and that the increase in sales for CVS 219 was due to the closing of other pharmacies in the area. (Quintero Decl. 1f 14; Email from Paul Farley to Michael Mone re: CVS #0219, Sept. 30, 2010.) In October 2010, Christopher Forst, the Director of Pharmacy Assessment, visited CVS 219 without informing CVS and did not see any indicia of diversion. (Quintero Decl. If 15; Email from Christopher Forst to Michael Mone re: CVS #219, Oct. 6,2010.) Further, Mone concluded that the volumes of oxycodone being distributed to the two CVS stores did not appear unreasonable in light of the stores' large size, and the fact that they were located in busy suburban neighborhoods, and were open seven days per week. (Feb. 6 Mone Decl. If 54.) Subsequently, in August 2011, the Company identified CVS 219 and 5195 as outliers and scheduled a meeting with CVS in late August, but the meeting was later rescheduled for October. (Quintero Decl. fflf 21-22.) On October 12, 2011, in response to an email from Mone raising concerns about several CVS stores, including CVS 5195, CVS stated that CVS had conducted a comprehensive review and had not found any evidence of diversion. (Apr. 13 Mone Decl. If 77; Quintero Decl. If 22; Email from Karen Gibbs to Michael Mone re: Florida Stores, Oct. 12, 2011.)    On October 18,2011, the DEA served warrants on CVS 219 and CVS 5195, and Cardinal Health lowered the oxycodone thresholds for these stores by significant amounts in November and December, respectively. (Apr. 13 Mone Decl. If 78.) Further, in Fall 2011, CVS stopped filling prescriptions written by twenty-two Florida doctors. As a result, the Company's distribution of oxycodone to CVS 219 and 5195 fell drastically in November and December 2011. (Apr. 13 Mone Decl. If 80.)    B.        Reaction to the 2012 ISO    1.        General Reactions Within the Company    In general, the reaction to the 2012 ISO was one of surprise and frustration, for a number of reasons.44 First, the overall belief among management and within QRA was that the anti-diversion program was effective, and that the Company was meeting or exceeding its obligations. The DEA visited the Company's corporate headquarters in early 2009 and reviewed the new anti-diversion program.  In addition, the DEA conducted at least twenty cyclical    A February 15, 2012 email to the Board, sent on behalf of Falk, included a transcript of a investor call which expressed the Company's surprise and frustration with the 2012 ISO in light of the Company's extensive improvements to the anti-diversion systems since 2007. (Email from Steve Falk to Cardinal Health Directors, Feb. 15,2012.)    33    CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY                                                                                                      CAH_HOUSE-003366    CAH  MDL PRIORPROD HOUSE 0003366     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1964-8  Filed:  07/23/19 38 of 43.  PagelD #: 163494    inspections of Cardinal Health distribution centers from 2008 through 2011, and did not issue any negative findings regarding the anti-diversion measures in place at those facilities. Moreover, in 2010, the Company retained John Gilbert, an attorney who had previously served in the diversion section of the DEA's Office of Chief Counsel, to perform an independent assessment of the anti-diversion system. Gilbert recommended four changes to the system, and the Company implemented each of those changes. All of these factors contributed to the sense that the Company had been successful in building the anti-diversion system.    Second, before the 2012 ISO, the Company was operating under the impression that if the Company performed its diligence on customers, it could rely on the pharmacist's expertise and judgment in analyzing customers and orders. However, the 2012 ISO was based almost entirely on the volumes that were shipped to the four pharmacies at issue, indicating that a shift needed to be made to viewing large volume orders as ""per se"" suspicious. Third, one of the difficulties the Company faces in detecting suspicious orders is a lack of information. HIPAA precludes pharmacies from sharing patient-specific information, including information about prescriptions, with distributors. Further, the DEA does not inform other distributors when one distributor terminates a customer, because it could be subject to civil liability for disclosing such information. The Company also is not privy to information regarding whether pharmacies are purchasing controlled substances from multiple distributors and the aggregate quantities of controlled substances purchased by pharmacies. (Morford Decl. 1) 19.) Fourth, the Company had terminated the two retail independent pharmacies at issue in the 2012 ISO months before it was issued, and significantly reduced the quantities being shipped to the two CVS stores at issue.    There was also the impression among some in management that, in hindsight, Morse and Mone should have terminated the independent pharmacies at issue in the 2012 ISO sooner. However, the system functioned properly by flagging each of the pharmacies at issue, and Morse and Mone made the decisions not to terminate those pharmacies in good faith, after reviewing the pharmacies and orders at issue.    In response to the 2012 ISO, the Company has attempted to reduce subjectivity in the system, and implement more objective criteria and procedures for reviewing pharmacies and orders. The view within management is that although there were good controls in place before the 2012 ISO, the Company has had to adjust certain measures to bring them in line with the current state of anti-diversion.    2.        Modifications to Anti-Diversion Policies and Procedures    a.        Personnel    In the months following the 2012 ISO, Mone was moved from his position as Vice President of Anti-Diversion into a position as attorney in the regulatory group, focusing on such things as training, policy development, and the Company's outreach efforts with boards of pharmacy. Mone continues to be recognized for implementing many effective anti-diversion measures, and possessing valuable knowledge and expertise. However, under Mone, the evaluation of customers and orders had been heavily focused on the clinical expertise and subjective judgment of the pharmacists in the anti-diversion group. The goal after the 2012 ISO    34    CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY    CAH_HOUSE-003367 CAH  MDL PRIORPROD HOUSE 0003367     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1964-8  Filed:  07/23/19 39 of 43.  PagelD #: 163495    was to move towards assessing customers based more on objective criteria and a practical knowledge about the business.    Morse was moved from his position as Director of Investigations to a position in regulatory management, outside the arena of controlled substance anti-diversion. The view was that Morse was not as strategic as his former position required and there were questions about his judgment. Specifically with respect to the pharmacies at issue in the 2012 ISO, management felt that Morse should have reviewed Gulf Coast more thoroughly.    b.        Monitoring Customers    The Company has continued its efforts to enhance the electronic monitoring system. In or around September 2012, the system moved to a linear regression model, which uses volume as a dependent variable and other factors as independent variables.    As a result of the Memorandum of Agreement entered into with the DEA in 2012 (the ""2012 MOA""), the Company has also made changes to the policies with respect to adjusting thresholds. The 2012 MOA requires a ""two-person concurrence . . . before increasing thresholds for higher volume customers for specific drug classes."" (2012 MOA at 3.) In general, there has been a concerted effort to treat threshold events more consistently and objectively. The review of thresholds is less of a subjective analysis based on the customers' ordering history and more focused on how the customers' prescription drug count compares with the national average. Accordingly, the analysts in Rausch's group are now responsible for responding to threshold events. Analysts will adjust thresholds in a limited set of circumstances, by applying objective, numerical criteria. Generally, if a pharmacy exceeds its threshold and the pharmacy or order does not fall within those limited circumstances in which an analyst can adjust the threshold and release the order, the order will not be filled and will be reported to the DEA as suspicious.    Pharmacists are responsible for responding to threshold events for long term care and hospital pharmacies, which do not lend themselves to the objective criteria applicable to retail pharmacies. Pharmacists are also responsible for continually reviewing the largest volume customers. In addition, the Company created a Large Volume-Tactical and Analytical Committee (""LV-TAC"") in response to the 2012 MOA, to review ""higher-volume retail and chain pharmacy customers, including higher-volume pharmacies in Florida."" (2012 MOA at 3.) LV-TAC holds monthly meetings and is comprised of numerous members across various departments. (See 2012 MOA at 3.)    During 2012, the salespeople started receiving additional information about their customers' ordering within a program called ""Winwatcher,"" a tool designed to help the salespeople track their customers and sales goals, among other functions. Winwatcher notifies salespeople when a customer's percentage of accrual of its threshold amount (for any controlled substance or listed chemical that is assigned a threshold) surpasses the percentage of completion for the month (e.g., a customer reaches 60% of its threshold on the fifteenth of the month). Winwatcher always shows customers' percentage of accrual for oxycodone, hydrocodone, and alprazolam, regardless of the time of the month. Further, although investigators and pharmacists    35    CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY    CAH_HOUSE-003368 CAH  MDL PRIORPROD HOUSE 0003368     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1964-8  Filed:  07/23/19 40 of 43.  PagelD #: 163496    at times conducted surveillance visits of chain stores before the 2012 ISO, it is now standard procedure for salespeople to conduct regular surveillance visits of chain pharmacies.45    c.         On-Site Investigations    In or around March or April 2012, the report used by investigators in conducting site visits changed from Word documents to Excel documents. The new report is an interactive document that asks for specific, objective data, thereby removing a great deal of subjectivity from the investigation process. There has also been more standardization in the procedures for site visits, and additional investigators have been hired as part of a concerted effort to shorten the time for completing investigations. Additionally, in an effort to increase transparency among departments, there is more frequent communication between investigators, pharmacists, and salespeople, about specific pharmacies and about whether and when a site visit is going to be conducted.    Moreover, the current Director of Investigations now reviews each site visit report and makes a concerted effort to provide timely feedback and guidance. Despite the requirement in the SOPs issued in 2008 that the Director of Investigations review each site visit report, Morse did not do that.    d.         Reporting Suspicious Orders    The prior approach to reporting suspicious orders to the DEA was to report an order as suspicious when the customer appeared suspicious, i.e., report an order that, after review, led the Company to terminate the customer as an unreasonable risk of diversion. The current approach is to report every order that is deleted and not filled, unless the order is the result of an entry error.    VII.     RECOMMENDATIONS ON MERITS OF ALLEGATIONS AND OTHER FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED    A.        Recommendations on Merits of Allegations    Based on the factual information the Committee gathered during its investigation, and its understanding of the applicable law, the Committee does not believe that it is in the best interest of the Company to pursue claims for breach of fiduciary duty against the present and former directors named in the Demand Letter, The investigation shows that the Board at all times acted diligently and in good faith to fulfill its duties to the Company and the Company's shareholders.    The Letter alleges that the 2012 ISO was the result of a failure by the Company ""to implement systems to detect and prevent the diversion of controlled substances into the illegal market"" in accordance with the CSA and the 2008 MOA. (Demand Letter at 1,10.) Further, the Letter alleges that the Directors and Officers of the Company ""breached their duties of loyalty    Since the 2012 ISO, the chains are more willing to collaborate with the Company on anti-diversion issues and the Company now receives more detailed information for individual chain stores.    36    CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY    CAH_HOUSE-003369 CAH  MDL PRIORPROD HOUSE 0003369     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1964-8  Filed:  07/23/19 41 of 43.  PagelD #: 163497    and care when they knowingly and/or recklessly failed to establish"" such a system of internal controls. (Id. at 10.)    As discussed, (see supraVari II), Ohio law provides that directors can be liable for damages only if they acted or failed to act with deliberate intent to cause injury to the corporation or with reckless disregard for the best interests of the corporation. See Ohio Rev. Code � 1701.59(E). Directors satisfy their obligation to remain informed of the corporation's activities if a reasonable information and reporting system exists within the company. See Caremark, 698 A.2d at 970-71. Where a reporting system exists, directors can be liable for breach of their oversight duty only if they ignore red flags that come to their attention warning of compliance problems. See Stanley, 2012 WL 5269147, at *6.    First, as this report makes clear, the Company implemented an extensive and robust system of internal controls to detect and prevent the diversion of controlled substances following the 2008 MOA, at a cost of approximately $25 million. The Board purposed for the Company to have a premier anti-diversion system. Hie Company brought in new management with extensive leadership, regulatory, and pharmaceutical experience, including Craig Morford, Gilberto Quintero, and Michael Mone, and hired experienced investigators and pharmacists to review potential new customers and monitor existing customers. The Company implemented an electronic monitoring system and set threshold ordering limits for customers based on statistical analyses of ordering data, and continued to improve the system and the underlying data. The Company developed a logistical regression model to compare existing customers to customers that had been terminated for posing unreasonable risks of diversion and hired a University Professor to validate the model. A centralized database was created to store and track data on customers and orders, thereby facilitating the monitoring process. Extensive policies and procedures were implemented for the anti-diversion group, salespeople, and personnel in the distribution centers. The Company administered anti-diversion training to thousands of employees. The Board was fully informed of the implementation of the anti-diversion measures, and received regular and detailed progress reports along the way.    Second, there were no red flags that the new anti-diversion controls were inadequate. The reaction of the Board, senior management, and QRA personnel to the 2012 ISO was one of surprise. The Company benchmarked the system with its competitors to the extent that it could, and hired outside consultants to test the system. By all accounts, management and QRA personnel were of the impression that the anti-diversion system was meeting or exceeding the Company's obligations to detect and report suspicious orders. Further, the Company received little, if any feedback from the DEA about the new system. The DEA reviewed the new anti-diversion system in early 2009 and inspected five distribution centers as part of the 2008 MOA. Although there were some initial concerns with one of the facilities, the Company rectified the issues and the DEA did not bring any formal proceedings. Moreover, the DEA conducted numerous routine cyclical inspections of the Company's distribution centers from 2008 through the end of 2011, and did not issue any negative findings regarding the anti-diversion measures. In fact, the DEA made positive comments during some of the inspections, indicating that the inspectors conducting those inspections were impressed, or at least satisfied with the compliance measures that were in place at the distribution centers. Senior management informed the Board that the inspections had been ""successful"" and that there were no negative findings regarding the SOM system from 2008 through 2011. In addition, management informed the Board that the    37    CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY    CAH_HOUSE-003370 CAH  MDL PRIORPROD HOUSE 0003370     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1964-8  Filed:  07/23/19 42 of 43.  PagelD #: 163498    electronic monitoring system flagged thousands of orders and led the Company to terminate and report many customers, and reduce the volume being distributed to many other customers. The Board was also informed that enhancements to the system in 2011 increased the accuracy of the system and reduced the number of false positives by a significant amount.    Indeed, the Demand Letter fails to identify a single red flag following the 2008 MOA that would have indicated that the Company's diversion controls were inadequate. Instead, the Letter tries to draw a connection between the allegations at issue in the 2007/2008 Action and the allegations at issue in the 2012 ISO. In other words, the issues that existed before the 2008 MOA were the red flags that the Company's anti-diversion controls were inadequate leading up to the 2012 ISO. This reasoning fails for two key reasons. First, the Company undertook a complete overhaul of its anti-diversion measures following the 2008 MOA, and implemented an entirely new system. The facility at issue in the 2012 ISO, the Lakeland facility, was reinstated in 2008 and underwent a ""Compliance Review"" in 2009 as part of the 2008 MOA and a cyclical inspection in 2010, both without incident. Second, the events at issue in the 2012 ISO were different from those at issue in the 2007/2008 Action. The 2012 ISO involved the sale of oxycodone, not hydrocodone as in the 2007/2008 Action. Further, the pharmacies at issue in 2007/2008 Action were different from those at issue in the 2012 ISO. Finally, the 2012 ISO apparently stemmed from an unannounced shift by the DEA to a strict emphasis on volume, both for retail independent pharmacies, as well as for chain pharmacies.46    Moreover, the facts surrounding the pharmacies at issue in the 2012 ISO make clear that the system did not fail, but largely succeeded. Indeed, the electronic monitoring system alerted personnel to the increased ordering of each of the pharmacies at issue in the 2012 ISO, and at least one investigator alerted his superiors to certain indicators of diversion at the independent pharmacies. Ultimately, the Company stopped shipment to the two independent pharmacies at issue months before the Company received the 2012 ISO, and the Company's oxycodone sales to the two CVS stores had also drastically decreased by that time. Mone and Morse decided, after investigating the pharmacies and orders, not to terminate those customers for a period of time. The law does not hold directors liable for the judgment calls that each employee renders in executing the Company's policies and procedures. The directors were obligated to ensure that a reasonable information and reporting system existed. The Company implemented a robust system of internal controls to detect and report suspicious orders in accordance with the CSA and the 2008 MOA, and the directors were well-informed of those measures.    Because the directors did not fail to act in the face of any red flags that the Company's anti-diversion controls were inadequate, let alone fail to act with a deliberate intent to cause harm to the Company or with reckless disregard for the best interests of the Company, the Company cannot recover monetary damages from the directors. (See Ohio Rev. Code � 1701.59(E).)    The 2007/2008 Action involved retail independent pharmacies involved in ""internet pharmacy"" activity and such activity was, for the most part, readily apparent from viewing the pharmacies' websites, and from the fact that the prescribers were outside the area where the prescriptions were being filled.    38    CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY    CAH_HOUSE-003371 CAH  MDL PRIORPROD HOUSE 0003371     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1964-8  Filed:  07/23/19 43 of 43.  PagelD #: 163499    B.        Other Factors to Be Considered    The Committee also concludes that a review of other factors supports its determination that litigation of the sort requested in the Demand Letter is not in the best interests of the Company. The Committee employed its business judgment to consider all of the corporate interests that may weigh in favor of pursuing the proposed action.    The legal and factual deficiencies of the proposed action, as outlined above, would make it likely that the action would be dismissed before a decision on the merits, or that the action would conclude with a finding that the directors fulfilled their fiduciary duties to the Company. Further, the proposed action would be certain to consume tremendous Company resources. It is probable that pretrial discovery would last many months, and involve extensive document discovery, as well as discovery disputes and motion practice. Many, if not all of the twenty-two present and former Board members named in the Demand Letter would be deposed, as well as many officers and other personnel. It is also reasonable to assume that the parties would retain expert witnesses. In addition, the proposed action would distract management and employees from their daily responsibilities. Such distraction would result from the time and effort required to participate in the litigation, as well as the uncertainties created by criticisms of the Company's anti-diversion policies and procedures, and the execution of those policies and procedures by personnel.    Moreover, it is likely that the Company would be obligated to indemnify the directors for their costs in defending against the proposed action. All but two of the directors named in the Demand Letter signed an Indemnification Agreement, which provides that the Company may indemnify a director for costs and expenses he or she reasonably incurs in an action in which the director is made a party as a result of serving as a director of the Company, except where the director's conduct is found ""to have been knowingly fraudulent, deliberately dishonest, or willful misconduct."" 47 (See Indemnification Agreement �� 1-2.) Because the directors acted in good faith at all times and diligently fulfilled their duties to the Company, the Committee concludes that the Company would likely be required to indemnify the directors for reasonable expenses they would incur in defending against an action of the sort requested in the Demand Letter. (See id.; see also Ohio Rev. Code � 1701.13.) The Committee finds that the expense of reimbursing the directors for litigation costs weighs against accepting the demand for claims with limited probability of success.    CONCLUSION    For the foregoing reasons, the Special Committee recommends that the Company not pursue the action requested by the Demand Letter.    Dave King and Clayton Jones, the most recent members of the Board, are entitled to indemnification under � 6.1 of the Restated Code of Regulations of Cardinal Health, Inc., which similarly provides for indemnification of costs and expenses that a director actually and reasonably incurs in an action where the director was a made a party as a result of his or her position as director.    39    CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY    CAH_HOUSE-003372 CAH  MDL PRIORPROD HOUSE 0003372 "

The delay was caused by the heavy workload associated with preparing materials for today's PMO, Please see attached for 2 slide decks reviewed at today's meeting.    The audience (Gilberto,. Bob, Linden, Todd) were impressed by our work and ""worried"" about who would be doing all the work after we leave. Ullrich, the new Investigations Director, joked: ""Todd, make sure you get Yi's contact information.""    The bottom fine is the new organization is losing focus already. More than half of the action items (decided at Sep. 25th meeting) were not completed and the sense of urgency, if not gone completely, at least was invisible.    The threshold-setting implementation was pushed back to December, significantly deviating from the Nov. 1 deadline that Gilberto has committed to George.    Gilberto was visibly disappointed and concerned.    Linden who described the current status as ""chaotic"", suggested we help re-structure the new organization (which I see the need as well) and supported my suggestion of re-visiting the customer profiling project, this is where HIVE can play a role - Scott, I brought this up 2 months ago and had it put it on the backburner to focus on the Sep. 11th roll-out.

PagelD #: 168705 Summary of the DEA-HDMA Meeting 4/15/08    DRAFT    Summary of the DEA-HDMA Meeting 4/15/08    The HDMA Industry Compliance Guidelines    Not for External Distribution    DEA Attendees: D. Linden Barber, Associate Chief Counsel, Diversion and Regulatory Litigation Section; Gary Boggs, Executive Assistant, Office of the Deputy Assistant Administrator; Mark Caverly, Chief Liaison and Policy Section; Robert C. (Chris) Gleason, Deputy Chief Counsel; Joseph T. Rannazzisi, Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion    HDMA Attendees: Robert Barnett, Richard Cooper, (Williams & Connolly); Anita Ducca, Scott Melville (HDMA); David Durkin (Olsson Frank Weeda Terman Bode    Matz)    Meeting summary:    Bob Barnett asked all attendees to introduce themselves. Chris Gleason thanked the    HDMA contingent for coming to DEA.    Then Bob explained the purpose of the meeting and what we hoped to accomplish. He explained the serious concerns among the HDMA members regarding DEA's recent actions regarding suspicious orders. When HDMA first contacted Williams and Connolly regarding possibly challenging DEA, Bob and Rich Cooper recommended an alternative that was based on his prior experience with other clients in similar positions. He recommended that distributors develop a set of ""business practices"" of their own, a type of ""standard,"" as a better approach to show to DEA and to the outside world that we intended to be part of the solution rather than the problem. Other points that Bob made were:    �    HDMA hopes that DEA would find the guidelines acceptable as a voluntary ""consent decree"", and that we hoped to ""receive some form of Imprimatur from you.""    �    We understood that DEA would not be able to give a specific response today, but we asked that DEA consider them and get back to us.    �    We also did not expect these guidelines to result in weakening DEA's enforcement prerogatives. We understood full well that DEA may still feel that in some cases enforcement action may be necessary even with such guidelines.    �     That one purpose of a trade association is to help transmit to its members an Agency's expectations. By putting forth such guidelines to DEA, we could help to facilitate such clarification.    �     They've been adopted and approved by HDMA's board. However, we suggest that DEA consider them and get back to us and we were open to DEA's suggestions and questions.    �    If DEA accepted these guidelines, we would like to make some form of public statement about them; we were open to doing so either jointly with DEA or separately. We also did not care if DEA took credit for them. From our perspective    CONFIDENTIAL    CAH MDL2804 02489188     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1965-78  Filed:  07/23/19 3 of 4.  PagelD #: 168706    the most important point was to have them in place to facilitate a common understanding of expectations.    After Bob's introductory remarks, he turned the meeting over to Rich Cooper. Rich gave a brief introduction from a previous experience he had been involved in where a set of voluntary standards were reviewed by FDA and eventually became a standard practice among the medical research community.    Rich then distributed copies of a set of the guidelines with highlighted key points, and walked the DEA staff through the document.   One key point Rich made was that the order in question would be stopped until there was an assessment and found that the order was not ""suspicious"".    The only question during Rich's explanation came from Mark Caverly. Mark requested clarification of ""what is stopped"".   Did that mean anything ""over the threshold"" would be stopped or would all of the order be stopped? Rich explained that the guidelines indicated that the entire order of the specific product that triggered the threshold should be held and not released. He also stated that other controlled substances that did not trigger the thresholds and non-controlled substances that were part of the same order could still be released. However, the guidelines expected that the entire order for the drug product in question would be held, even if part of it came in under the threshold.    After Rich described the document, he turned the discussion over to Scott Melville to explain HDMA's plans for moving forward from here.  Scott explained our anticipated actions for launching the guidelines, following the description we included in our list. He noted that we have had a lot of experience over the years with actions and education to secure the supply chain from the threat of counterfeit drugs and that our initiative on suspicious would have many similarities.    Scott explained that we intended to make the Industry Compliance Guidelines very public and announce it to the press, and said we were open to doing so jointly or separately with DEA, but that we wanted a broad announcement. He spoke about all our planned actions, and particularly noted:    �    We intended to help our members implement the guidelines by making consultants known to them that could aid in implementation,    �     We will discuss, explain and encourage acceptance of the guidleines by other trade associations, including manufacturing and pharmacy groups. Further, we would encourage them to prepare something similar,    �    We'll discuss it with the pain Care Forum,    �    Work with members of Congress,    �    Hold Webinars and Seminars and engage in other broad education efforts for our members and customers.    �    We also anticipated looking at the development of continuing pharmacy education so that pharmacists would have a basis of understanding what efforts they might make to help avoid similar problems.

PagelD #: 168707    After Scott's discussion, Chris Gleason thanked us for our efforts, and noted (in an encouraging fashion) that DEA welcomed this dialogue, and recognized the need for cooperative efforts. He noted that DEA sometimes hesitates [to acknowledge or ""approve"" such documents] given the tendency for the rapid change in the drug trade. DEA sometimes needs the flexibility to change strategies when something comes along that requires a different approach than what might be contained in such a guideline. Bob responded that we attempted to build flexibility into the guidelines to accommodate such changes.    Scott noted that it was also important, however, for our members to obtain clarity regarding DEA's expectations. Our members distribute 7-9 million drug products daily and that with such a high volume of products needed for patient care, it was important to minimize uncertainties. He commented that wholesale distributors can't be involved in the practice of medicine, since we are not the practitioners. However, there are other things we can do to help seek solutions to the problem.    Chris thanked us again and said that he thought we should stay in contact and meet again after DEA had a chance to review the document more closely. He stated he thought we could follow-up ""in about a month.""    [Subsequent to the meeting, Bob Barnett indicated he would contact Chris in about a week to follow-up.]    [PAGE ]    CONFIDENTIAL                                                                                                                                         CAH MDL2804 02489190 "

Notice is also given to afford Walgreens an opportunity to show cause before DEA in Arlington, Virginia, or a location designated by the Administrative Law Judge, on November 13, 2012 (if Walgreens requests such a hearing), as to why DEA should not revoke Walgreens's DEA Certificate of Registration RW0277752, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. � 824(a)(4), deny any pending applications for renewal or modification of such registration, and deny any applications for additional registration, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. � 823(b) & (e), because Walgreens' continued registration is inconsistent with the public interest, as that term is defined in 21 U.S.C. � 823(b) & (e). The basis for this Order to Show Cause and Immediate Suspension of Registration is set forth in the following nonexhaustive summary of facts and law {see 21 C.F.R. �� 1301.36(e) and 1301.37(c), which DEA construes in pari materia in this context.)    1.   Walgreens' Jupiter Florida Distribution Center is registered with DEA as a distributor in Schedules II-V pursuant to DEA Certificate of Registration RW0277752 at 15998 Walgreens Drive, Jupiter, Florida 33478. DEA Certificate of Registration RW0277752 expires by its terms on May 31, 2013. The Jupiter Distribution Center is one of 12 Distribution Centers owned and operated by the Walgreen Corporation,     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1965-17 Filed: 07/23/19 4 of 56.  PagelD #: 167058    headquartered in Deerfield, Illinois. Walgreens also operates more than 7800 Walgreens retail pharmacies in the United States.    2.   Since at least 2009, the State of Florida has been the epicenter of a notorious, well-documented epidemic of prescription drug abuse. In July 2011, the Florida Surgeon General declared a Public Health Emergency based on the prescription pill epidemic which results in an average of seven overdose deaths per day In Florida. The drags most commonly associated with this epidemic are typically prescribed at unscrupulous pain clinics by physicians acting outside the usual course of professional practice and include Schedule II pain relievers, such as oxycodone; Schedule IV benzodiazepines such as alprazolam, and Schedule IV muscle relaxers, such as carisoprodol. Frequently, these drags are prescribed in large amounts and in combination with each other as ""cocktails"" popular with drag seeking individuals. See East Main Street Pharmacy, 75 Fed. Reg, 66149, 66153, (2010); Paul H, Volkman, 73 FR 30630, 30633-34, 30639 (2008), pet. for rev. denied, Volkman v. DEA, 567 F.3d 1215 (6th Cir. 2009).    3.   Oxycodone is a dangerously addictive Schedule II controlled substance which is known to be highly abused and diverted in the State of Florida. According to the 2010 Florida Medical Examiner's Commission Drag Report, the drug that caused the most deaths in the state of Florida for 2010 was oxycodone (1,516 deaths), followed by benzodiazepines (1,304 deaths of which 981 were caused by alprazolam.)    4.   Since 2009, Walgreens' Jupiter, Florida Distribution Center has been the single largest distributor of oxycodone products in Florida. At about the same time as the abuse of prescription drags became an epidemic in Florida, Walgreens' Florida retail pharmacies, supplied by Respondent, commanded an increasingly large percentage of the state's growing oxycodone business. In 2010, only 3 Walgreens retail pharmacies were in the top 100 purchasers of oxycodone within Florida. In 2011, 38 Walgreens pharmacies made the top 100 and 6 were in the top 10. Through May 2012, 44 Walgreens pharmacies are in the top 100 oxycodone purchasers, all of them supplied by Respondent.    5.   According to DEA records, in 2011, Walgreens operated 7,862 retail pharmacies in the United States. Sixteen of the top 25 largest Walgreens retail oxycodone purchasers, including the top 6 purchasers, were in Florida and supplied by Respondent. The following table shows these 6 stores and their yearly oxycodone purchases for 2009 through 2011:    CONFIDENTIAL    WAGMDL00387655     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1965-17 Filed: 07/23/19 5 of 56.

Pierce, FL    An ongoing DEA investigation of Respondent's distribution practices and policies, combined with both a general examination of dispensing at Walgreens Florida pharmacies as well as a detailed investigation of the dispensing practices at the six pharmacies identified above, demonstrates that Respondent has failed to maintain effective controls against the diversion of controlled substances into other than legitimate medical, scientific, and industrial channels, in violation of 21 U.S.C. �� 823(b)(1) and (e)(1). Respondent failed to conduct adequate due diligence of its retail stores, including but not limited to, the six stores identified above, and continued to distribute large amounts of controlled substances to pharmacies that it knew or should have known were dispensing those controlled substances pursuant to prescriptions written for other than a legitimate medical purpose by practitioners acting outside the usual course of their professional practice. See Southwood Pharm., Inc., 72 Fed. Reg. 36,487 (2007) (revocation based in part on the respondent's recurring distributions of extraordinary quantities of controlled substances to entities that likely diverted the controlled substances by filling unlawful prescriptions, as well as the respondent's failure to conduct due diligence sufficient to protect against the diversion of the controlled substances it distributed).    DEA's investigation of Respondent also revealed that Walgreens failed to detect and report suspicious orders by its pharmacy customers, in violation of 21 C.F.R. �1301.74(b). 21 C.F.R. � 1301.74(b) (distributors are required to ""design and operate a system to disclose to the registrant suspicious orders of controlled substances ... suspicious orders include orders of unusual size, orders deviating substantially from a normal pattern, and orders of unusual frequency.""); see also Southwood Pharm., Inc., 72 Fed. Reg. at 36,502 (finding that the respondent repeatedly violated federal regulations by failing to report suspicious orders). Walgreens knew or should have known about their obligations to report suspicious orders, as such obligations were spelled out in detail in three letters from DEA's Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, sent to every registered manufacturer and distributor, including Respondent, on September 27, 2006, February 7, 2007, and December 27, 2007. The purpose and proper implementation of suspicious order reporting programs was further discussed in the industry's own trade association, the    3     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1965-17 Filed: 07/23/19 6 of 56.  PagelD #: 167060    Healthcare Distribution Management Association (HDMA), in ""Industry Compliance Guidelines: Reporting Suspicious Orders and Preventing Diversion of Controlled Substances"" published in 2008.'    8.   Notwithstanding the ample guidance available, Walgreens has failed to maintain an adequate suspicious order reporting system and as a result, has ignored readily identifiable orders and ordering patterns that, based on the information available throughout the Walgreens Corporation, should have been obvious signs of diversion occurring at Respondent's customer pharmacies. See 21 C.F.R. � 1301.74(b); see also Southwood Pharm., Inc., 72 Fed. Reg. 36,487 (2007).    9.   Respondent's practice with regard to suspicious order reporting was to send to the local DEA field office a monthly report labeled ""Suspicious Control Drug Orders."" Two reports were provided, one for suspicious orders of Schedule II drags, another for suspicious orders of drags in Schedules III through V. These reports were transmitted on Respondent's behalf from Walgreens Corporate headquarters in Deerfield, Illinois. Respondent's suspicious order report for December 2011 appears to include suspicious orders placed by its customers for the past 6 months. The report for just suspicious orders of Schedule II drugs is 1712 pages and includes reports on approximately 836 pharmacies in more than a dozen states and Puerto Rico. The reports are based on a formula that assigns an average monthly order for a particular drug, which is then multiplied by a ""DEA factor"" (which is always 3, regardless of the drug or the average order amount), resulting in a ""Trigger"" amount, above which orders for the month are reported as suspicious, along with a listing of all orders placed for the particular drug by the reported pharmacy for the month in which the ""Trigger"" amount was exceeded. This report from the Jupiter Distribution Center covers pharmacies in multiple states and Puerto Rico, yet the average order and trigger amount is the same for a particular drug regardless of the pharmacy's location, the population it serves, or the number of other pharmacies in the area.    10. As made clear in 21 CFR � 1301.74(b), Southwood, and the December 27, 2007 letter to distributors from the Deputy Assistant Administrator for the Office of Diversion Control, suspicious orders are to be reported as discovered, not in a collection of monthly completed transactions. Moreover, commensurate with the obligation to identify and report suspicious orders as they are discovered is the obligation to conduct meaningful due diligence in an investigation of the customer and the particular order to resolve the suspicion and verify that the order is actually being used to fulfill legitimate medical needs. This analysis must take place before the order is shipped.   No order identified as suspicious should be fulfilled until an assessment of the order's legitimacy is concluded.   As such, Respondent's reports, consisting of nothing more than an aggregate of completed transactions, did not comply with the requirement to report suspicious orders as discovered, despite the title Respondent attached to these reports.    1 See http:/V\vwwJiealtlicaredismbutiori.org/goy_affairs/pdf.....control led/20081113.......icg.pdf.    4    CONFIDENTIAL    WAGMDL00387657     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1965-17  Filed:  07/23/19 7 of 56.  PagelD #: 167061    11. A review of the documents Respondent provided as evidence of its ""due diligence"" on the above listed six pharmacies, demonstrates that Respondent failed to conduct any meaningful investigation or analysis to ensure that the massive amounts of commonly abused, highly addictive controlled substances being ordered by these pharmacies were not being diverted into other than legitimate channels. In response to DEA requests, Respondent has been unable to provide any files related to any effort to adequately verify the legitimacy of any particular order it shipped to its customer stores.    12. Respondent's employee with overall responsibility for Schedule II drug operations (the ""CII Function Manager""), raised questions within the corporation about what she correctly identified as unusually large orders for Schedule II narcotics placed regularly by several customer pharmacies. Based on the evidence available to DEA, none of these orders were reported to DEA as suspicious and all appear to have been shipped, without any further due diligence to verify their legitimacy. For example:    a.    In January 2011, Jupiter's CII Function Manager expressed concern about the enormous volume of 30 mg oxycodone being ordered by three stores, Walgreens #'s 7298, 3836, and 5018, concluding in an email to the ""Manager, Rx Inventory Drug Stores"" at Walgreens' Corporate Headquarters in Deerfield, Illinois, that she felt the stores needed ""to justify the large quantity."" With regard to store # 3836 in Port RIchey, Florida, she noted that Respondent had shipped this store 3271 bottles of 100 count 30 mg oxycodone (i.e., 327,100 dosage units) in the 40 day period from 12/1/10 to 1/10/11, causing her to question ""how they can even house this many boitlefsj."" She then inquired of the same corporate manager:  ""How do we go about checking the validity of these orders? ""    b.   Despite having raised these concerns from the distributor to a supervisor at corporate headquarters, none of these orders were reported as suspicious and there appears to have been no other inquiry conducted into the circumstances of the enormous amount of narcotics being shipped to store # 3836 in Port Richey, a town of less than 3000 people in a county with a population of only approximately 475,000. Despite the fact that a distribution center manager had raised questions about this store's ordering volume to a corporate manager in January 2011, the very next month, Respondent filled and shipped orders totaling another 285,800 dosage units of 30 milligram oxycodone to the same pharmacy. Again, there is no evidence of any due diligence conducted by Respondent or anyone else within the corporation to verify the legitimacy of these orders in order to fulfill their obligation to maintain effective controls against diversion.    13. According to documents received from Walgreens Corporate Headquarters, on April 2, 2012, Walgreens revised its suspicious order policy, but made the policy retroactively effective to January 1, 2012. The policy states, in pertinent part, that ""Effective calendar year 2012, the Controlled Substance Order Monitoring and Prevention System prevents suspicious control drugs from being shipped to the stores. In calendar year 2012, because of the program mentioned, suspicious control drug reports are no longer generated as their shipment is prevented by the system.""    5    CONFIDENTIAL    WAGMDL00387658     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1965-17 Filed: 07/23/19 8 of 56.  PagelD #: 167062    14. This policy ignores the fact that the reporting requirement of 21 CFR � 1301.74(b) applies to orders, not shipments. A suspicious order placed by a customer pharmacy is made no less suspicious by application of a system designed to reduce or eliminate such orders prior to shipping. Construing the regulation this way defeats the essential purpose of the suspicious order requirement, which, as I stated in Southwood, is ""to provide investigators in the field with information regarding potential illegal activity in an expeditious manner."" 72 FR at 36501.    15. Respondent's local DEA field office within the Miami Field Division has not received a suspicious order report for any orders placed in 2012, despite the fact that Respondent has received and shipped multiple orders this year that, using the criteria Walgreens employed in 2011, would have exceeded the trigger amount previously used to report these sales.    16. The available evidence suggests that Respondent's abdication of its responsibilities as an individual registrant was at least facilitated by a push from Walgreens Corporate headquarters to increase oxycodone sales at its Florida retail pharmacies, all of which received their Schedule II controlled substances from Respondent. I also note that during the relevant time herein, Walgreens had in effect compensation programs for pharmacy employees in which bonuses were based on the number of prescriptions filled at the pharmacy. This bonus program, combined with a concerted, corporate directed effort to increase oxycodone sales, served as an incentive for pharmacists and pharmacy technicians to ignore the ""red flags"" of diversion presented by these prescriptions, many of which, in the proper exercise of the pharmacist's corresponding responsibility under 21 CFR � 1306.04(a), should have resulted in a refusal to fill.    a.    In July 2010, Walgreens' corporate headquarters conducted an analysis of oxycodone dispensing for the prior month at its Florida retail pharmacies and produced an 11 page spreadsheet, ranking all Florida stores by the number of oxycodone prescriptions dispensed in June. The spreadsheet was sent to Walgreens' market pharmacy supervisors in Florida on July 29, 2010, with the admonition that they ""look at stores on the bottom end .... We need to make sure we aren 't turning legitimate scripts away. Please reinforce"" A corporate market director of pharmacy operations did reinforce this message to Florida market pharmacy supervisors, highlighting that their ""busiest store in Florida"" was filling almost 18 oxycodone prescriptions per day, yet ""We also have stores doing about I a day. Are we turning away good customers?""    b.   At roughly the same time as Walgreens' supervisors were urging its Florida pharmacies to increase their oxycodone sales, Florida enacted new laws to combat the prescription drug abuse problem, particularly the devastating effects of oxycodone and other abused drugs dispensed directly from rogue pain clinics, commonly known as ""pill mills."" These new laws went into effect on October 1, 2010 and severely restricted the ability of pain clinics and physicians to dispense controlled substances directly from the clinics. The purpose of these legislative changes was to stem the overwhelming tide of controlled substances being    6     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1965-17 Filed: 07/23/19 9 of 56.  PagelD #: 167063    diverted from pill mills and into illicit channels for sale and recreational abuse. As a result, Florida pharmacies and the distributors who served them knew or should have known that starting in late 2010, there would be a significant increase in requests to dispense pursuant to prescriptions issued by physicians associated with the pain clinics.    c.    Walgreens store # 06997 in Oviedo, Florida, was ranked 444th on the above-referenced Walgreens' ranking of oxycodone sales generated at its Florida retail pharmacies, filling on average only 4 oxycodone prescriptions per day in June 2010. DEA tracks pharmacy activity not by prescriptions but by dosage units of a particular drug purchased by the pharmacy for retail sales. In 2010, the national average for oxycodone sales to retail pharmacies was 70,395 dosage units per year, or about 5,866 dosage units per month. This store's oxycodone sales began to Increase drastically, as shown by the fact that in June 2010, Walgreens store #06997 purchased just 6,600 dosage units of oxycodone products. One year later, in June 2011, this same pharmacy purchased 169,700 dosage units of oxycodone.    d.   Oviedo is a town of about 34,000 people and is home to two Walgreens retail pharmacies. Beginning in late 2010, these two pharmacies became the site of multiple arrests by the local police for drug offenses. The local Chief of Police began writing letters to the pharmacies after each arrest stemming from prescriptions they filled. These letters informed the pharmacy of the circumstances of the arrest and that the dispensed drugs were not being used for treatment. They further provided the pharmacy with the name and date of birth not only of the person whose prescription they filled, but also of others associated with the illegal distribution of the dispensed drugs. These letters then concluded with a request for the pharmacy's help in ""dealing with the prescription medication epidemic"" by soliciting a commitment to stop further incidents.    e.    The Oviedo Police Chiefs concerns reached the highest levels of Walgreens' Loss Prevention Operations, with the Director of Divisional Loss Prevention noting in an email on January 28, 2011 that ""fejvidentfy the Chief of Police is concerned that we are filling too many C2 prescriptions.... From what I've been told, he is referencing 100 plus incidents/arrests in his jurisdiction."" Walgreens' response was to ""lake a look at this market. . . and see if we have an increase in dispensing.""    f.    The Oviedo Police Chief convened a meeting with Walgreens Loss Prevention    officials on February 10, 2011, in an effort to further bring awareness of the problems he was seeing at their stores and to brief them on the number of arrests at each location. On March 15,2011, he sent identical letters to both the Chairman and CEO of Walgreens, asking them for their support and assistance in combating the prescription drug epidemic, Informing them that Oviedo ""has seen the parking lots of your stores become a bastion of illegal drug sales and drug use"" where once the prescriptions are filled, ""the drugs are sold, distributed as payment, crushed and snorted, liquefied and injected, or multiple pills swallowed while in the parking lot of your pharmacies.""    7     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1965-17 Filed: 07/23/19 10 of 56.  PagelD #: 167064    g.   Despite being informed at the highest levels of ongoing diversion and drug-related criminal activity directly stemming from dispensing at these pharmacies, and bearing in mind that the average U.S. retail pharmacy in 2011 purchased only 73,000 dosage units ofall formulations of oxycodone for the entire year, the Walgreens corporation, through Respondent, responded to this information about one of its stores by shipping the following quantities of 30 milligram formulation oxycodone to Oviedo store 06997:    (i)   February 2011           75,300 dosage units    (ii) March 2011               72,900 dosage units    (iii) April 2011                 101,700 dosage units    (iv) May 2011                  133,900 dosage units    (v) June 2011                  115,200 dosage units    (vi) July 2011                  145,300 dosage units    h.   Perhaps even more significant than the enormous amount of oxycodone    Respondent shipped to this store despite the information provided by the Chief of Police to its pharmacists and most senior leaders, is the fact that the dispensing records for both Oviedo Walgreens pharmacies show that on multiple occasions, they each dispensed additional prescriptions of commonly diverted narcotics to the same individuals who they knew had been previously arrested for drug offenses at their pharmacies. I find this to be a staggering disregard of Walgreens' obligations under the Controlled Substances Act.    17. While the detailed information provided by the Chief of Police put Respondent and its parent company on notice of actual diversion occurring at the two Oviedo pharmacies, Respondent had ample other indications that its pharmacies were direct and significant contributors to the epidemic of prescription drug abuse and diversion in Florida, yet It largely ignored these indicators, at all levels of the corporate structure. An inexhaustive description of some of these indicators are the following:    a.   On September 27, 2010, a pharmacist working at Walgreens # 04727 in Ft. Pierce reported to law enforcement that he mistakenly provided an extra 120 dosage units of 15 milligram oxycodone to a customer. When the pharmacist tried to call the customer to request he return the mistakenly dispensed oxycodone, he was told by the customer's girlfriend that the customer was an addict who sells his pills and views the extra oxycodone as a ""pot of gold"" which he would not return. Despite this incident, Walgreens # 04727 filled several additional oxycodone prescriptions issued to this customer in December 2010 and January 2011.    8     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1965-17 Filed: 07/23/19 11 of 56.  PagelD #: 167065    b.   On November 4,2010, a Walgreens # 04727 pharmacist reported to police that she dispensed a prescription for 60 dosage units of oxycodone 15mg to a twenty-four year old male who she then witnessed transfer the drags to a female in the store. The female entered the pharmacy restroom, leaving behind evidence indicating she had smoked the oxycodone. Despite this incident, Walgreens    # 04727 continued to fill the same customer's oxycodone and alprazolam prescriptions on several occasions in November and December 2010 and January 2011.    c.    On December 21, 2010, a pharmacist employed by Walgreens Pharmacy # 3629 in Hudson, Florida reported to the Pasco County (Florida) Sheriffs Office that an individual had attempted to fill a prescription for 270 dosage units of thirty milligram oxycodone, but ran from the pharmacy after learning the pharmacy had contacted law enforcement, suspecting the prescription was a forgery. Despite this incident, the same pharmacy that reported this customer to the Sheriffs Office in December continued to fill the same customer's oxycodone prescriptions in February, March, April, May and October of 2011.    18. On or about March 2011, corporate officials at Walgreens headquarters in Illinois initiated a Florida pharmacy store review initially entitled ""Focus on Profit"" and later changed to ""Focus on Compliance."" The purpose of this review was to address the ""significant increase in the number of [Schedule II controlled substance] prescriptions we are filling In [Florida]"" after the October 2010 change in Florida law regarding pain clinics. The initial pilot survey asked the following questions, amongst others: ""Do pain management clinic patients come all at once or in a steady stream?"" and ""Do you see an increase in pain management prescriptions on the day the warehouse order is received?"" On May 17, 2011, in an email with the subject heading ""Florida Focus on Profit,"" a Walgreen Co. corporate attorney reviewed the survey and regarding these two questions, stated ""If these are legitimate indicators of inappropriate prescriptions perhaps we should consider not documenting our own potential noncompliance."" The surveys that ultimately were used in the Focus on Compliance initiative did not contain those questions. By omitting these questions in order to avoid gathering information pertinent to whether or not pain clinic patients were engaged in diversion, the Walgreens Corporation and Respondent as a corporate subsidiary, ignored Its statutory and regulatory obligation to maintain effective controls against the diversion of controlled substances Into other than legitimate medical, scientific, and industrial channels. See 21 U.S.C, � 823(b) and (e).    19. Apparently as part of this ""Focus On Compliance,"" Walgreens sought to develop and implement ""Oxycodone Action Plans"" within its districts in Florida in an attempt to reduce the volume of oxycodone dispensing on behalf of pain clinics. For store    # 3629 in Hudson, the plan devised by District Pharmacy and Loss Prevention supervisors In a memo dated August 23, 2011 included ""contacting the Jupiter warehouse and designating order limits for Oxycodone. "" The plan, effective immediately, was to ""limit"" the Hudson store to orders of no more than 100 bottles of 100 count 30 milligram oxycodone. Notwithstanding the memo and the plan to limit store #3629's purchases to no more than 100 bottles, Respondent subsequently    9     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1965-17  Filed:  07/23/19  12 of 56.  PagelD #: 167066    shipped the following orders to store 3629:    Date   Bottles   Dosage Units    09/26/11   331   33,100    10/10/11   371   37,100    11/29/11   200   20,000    12/06/11   113   11,300    12/13/11   150   15,000    Respondent's inability to enforce a very simple, modest limitation on this one pharmacy is further evidence of its failure to maintain effective controls against diversion, even in the rare instance when it tried to do so.    20. In mid to late 2011 and continuing into 2012, Walgreens undertook to reduce the volume of oxycodone dispensing at its high-volume pharmacies and in some cases, did, in fact, achieve a relatively significant reduction in Schedule II dispensing at these stores.   Additionally, in late May, 2012, approximately seven weeks after Administrative Inspection Warrants were served on six Walgreens retail pharmacies and Respondent, Walgreens suspended dispensing of Schedule II drags as well as Alprazolam and Carisoprodol at these six pharmacies and two others. In my assessment of the imminent danger posed by Respondent's continued registration, I have considered these remedial measures, as well as Walgreens' claims that it continues to revise its suspicious order reporting system to prevent the excesses that occurred in 2010 and 2011. In my judgment, and in the exercise of the discretion afforded me by 21 U.S.C. � 824(d), the danger posed by Respondent's continued registration is only slightly mitigated by the dispensing restrictions enacted at these eight pharmacies.    21. To reiterate, my concerns with Respondent's distribution practices are not limited to the six Walgreens pharmacies discussed herein. Respondent distributes to over 800 other retail pharmacies in Florida alone, many of which dispense oxycodone in amounts far in excess of the U.S. and Florida averages and which also experienced dramatic increases in their distribution of oxycodone from at least 2009 to the present. No fewer than 43 Walgreens pharmacies in Florida purchased in excess of 500,000 dosage units of oxycodone in 2011, despite a national average of approximately 74,000 dosage units for all U.S. pharmacies and an average of approximately 110,00 dosage units for all Florida Walgreens pharmacies. Florida remains the epicenter of this country's prescription drug abuse problem and notwithstanding the cessation of Schedule II dispensing at eight of its retail customers, Respondent remains the top distributor of the most dangerous prescription drags in Florida, and still has not made a single suspicious order report in calendar year 2012.    10    CONFIDENTIAL    WAGMDL00387663     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1965-17  Filed:  07/23/19  13 of 56.  PagelD #: 167067    22. Through May of this year, Respondent's customers included 44 Walgreens retail pharmacies on the list of the 100 top oxycodone purchasing pharmacies in Florida.2 Respondent continues to distribute large amounts of oxycodone while it appears to    continue to misunderstand or ignore its obligation to maintain effective controls against diversion by reporting suspicious orders and conducting due diligence on its customer stores to verify the legitimacy of their orders. Thus, the fact that Walgreens stopped selling Schedule II controlled substances to a handful of retail pharmacies -virtually all of which Walgreens also knew were themselves under DEA investigation at the time Walgreens stopped distributing to these pharmacies - does little to mollify my concerns about the danger posed by Respondent's continued operation. The nature and significance of the problems revealed by DEA's investigation indicate that Respondent's anti-diversion measures are inadequate generally; the problems do not appear to be limited to the pharmacies discussed herein. Consequently, I believe that Respondent's continued operation poses an imminent danger to public health and safety.    23. Voluntary dispensing restrictions enacted either in anticipation of, or in reaction to regulatory action, do not indicate to me that Respondent and its parent company have recognized and adequately reformed the systemic shortcomings discussed herein. On the contrary, when a company undertakes to survey its stores for regulatory compliance, then selectively edits that survey for the explicit purpose of avoiding evidence of its own non-compliance, as Walgreens apparently did in May 2011, claims of effective remedial measures have less credibility. I gave significant weight to the fact that Walgreens appears to have deliberately structured certain of its anti-diversion measures to avoid learning about and/or documenting evidence consistent with diversion. At best, I regard this as deliberate indifference on Walgreens' part as to its obligations as a DEA registrant.    24. My confidence in Walgreens' remedial measures is lessened further by the fact that this manipulation of the compliance survey occurred just one month after Walgreens entered into a nationwide Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with DEA to resolve an Order to Show Cause issued to a San Diego Walgreens pharmacy based on allegations of unlawful dispensing. Walgreens pledged in this MO A to enact a compliance program at all of its retail pharmacies to detect and prevent diversion of controlled substances and to implement and maintain policies and procedures to ensure that prescriptions for controlled substances are only dispensed to authorized individuals pursuant to federal and state law and regulations. Walgreens' effort to enact such a program in Florida appears to have been, in part, intentionally skewed to avoid actually detecting certain evidence of possible diversion. That Walgreens would actively seek to avoid documenting evidence of possible diversion in its ""Focus on Compliance"" in Florida immediately after entering this MOA, further contributes to my preliminary finding that Respondent's continued registration during    2 By way of comparison, only two other national or regional chain pharmacies have stores on this list, one of which has four stores in the top 100, while the other has three.    11     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1965-17 Filed: 07/23/19 14 of 56.  PagelD #: 167068    the pendency of this proceeding constitutes an imminent danger to the public health    and safety.    IN view of the foregoing, and based on information before the Agency as of the issuance of this notice, it is my preliminary finding pursuant to 21 U.S.C. �� 823(f) and 824(a)(4), that Walgreens' continued registration is inconsistent with the public interest. Under the summarized facts and circumstances described herein, it is also my preliminary finding, significantly in light of the rampant and deadly problem of prescription controlled substance abuse in Florida, that Respondent's continued registration while these proceedings are pending constitutes an imminent danger to the public health and safety. See 21 U.S.C. � 824(d). Accordingly, pursuant to the provisions of 21 U.S.C. � 824(d) and 21 C.F.R. � 1301.36(e), and the authority granted me under 28 C.F.R. � 0.100, DEA Certificate of Registration RW0277752 is hereby suspended, effective immediately. Such suspension shall remain in effect until a final determination is reached in these proceedings.3    PURSUANT to 21 U.S.C. � 824(f) and 21 C.F.R. � 1301.36(f), the Special Agents and Diversion Investigators of the DEA who serve this Order to Show Cause and Immediate Suspension of Registration are authorized to place under seal or to remove for safekeeping all controlled substances that Walgreens possesses pursuant to the registration which I have herein suspended. The said Agents and Investigators are also directed to take into their possession Walgreens's DEA Certificate of Registration RW0277752 and any unused order forms.    THE following procedures are available to you in this matter:    1.   Within 30 days after the date of receipt of this Order to Show Cause and Immediate Suspension of Registration, Walgreens may file with the DEA a written request for a hearing in the form set forth in 21 C.F.R. � 1316.47. See 21 C.F.R. � 1301.43(a). If Walgreens fails to file such a request, the hearing shall be cancelled in accordance with paragraph 3, below.    2.   Within 30 days after the date of receipt of this Order to Show Cause and Immediate Suspension of Registration, Walgreens may file with the DEA a waiver of hearing together with a written statement regarding its respective positions on the matters of fact and law involved. See 21 C.F.R. � 1301.43(c).    3.   Should Walgreens decline to file a request for a hearing or, should Walgreens request a hearing and then fail to appear at the designated hearing, Walgreens shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing and the DEA may cancel    31 have primarily addressed Schedule II controlled substances based on Walgreens' representations that Respondent no longer distributes controlled substances other than Schedule II. This should not be construed as an indication that DEA has concluded that Respondent's distribution practices relating to non-schedule II controlled substances conform to all applicable requirements and obligations. To the contrary, many of the problematic distribution practices noted herein would raise imminent danger concerns with respect to non-Schedule II controlled substances if Respondent were to continue to distribute them.    12     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1965-17  Filed:  07/23/19  15 of 56.

Deputy Assistant Administrator Joseph Rannazzisi    Deputy Assistant Administrator Rannazzisi will describe his background, education and training as a DEA Deputy Assistant Administrator, a law enforcement officer, and a licensed pharmacist. He will further testify substantially as follows:    Prescription drug abuse occurs in the United States at an alarming rate. The 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Health reveals that approximately 7 million Americans abuse controlled substance phanriaeeuticals for non-medical purposes. Second only to marijuana, controlled .substance prescription drugs are abused by more people than cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens and inhalants combined. Of all prescription drugs, narcotic pain relievers such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, and oxymorphone are abused most frequently. Each year, roughly 5.1 million people abuse narcotic pain relievers in the United States.    Beginning in late 2008 and continuing to the present, there has been a significant rise in the number of rogue pain clinics whose complied doctors were initially permitted to dispense millions of dosage units of oxycodone and other abused drugs directly from the clinics. Florida is the epicenter for these illegal pain clinics.   DEA, State and local law enforcement investigations reveal that thousands of drug seekers flock to these Florida-based pain clinics to obtain their supply of oxycodone, and other controlled substances such as alprazolam, which is    4     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1965-17 Filed: 07/23/19 22 of 56.  PagelD #: 167076    in turn illegally redistributed in states along the entire east coast and Midwest.    The illicit pain clinics, the pharmacies that fill their scripts, and the wholesale distributors who supply pharmacies without appropriate due diligence (including Respondent), have caused, and continue to cause, millions of dosage units of oxycodone and other controlled substances to be diverted, posing a serious threat to the public health and safety. According to the Florida Medical Examiner's Office, they have seen a 345.9% increase in the number of overdose deaths associated with oxycodone between 2005 and 2010.   For 2010, their data showed that approximately 4,091 persons died in Florida alone from an overdose caused by just five drugs: methadone, oxycodone, hydrocodone, benzodiazepines, or morphine.    Furthermore, the abuse of prescription drugs is not isolated to just one drug. Abusers and addicts routinely abuse prescription drugs in combination with one another to enhance the effects. This activity significantly increases the risk of potential harm to the individual. This combination is often referred to as a ""cocktail"" of hydrocodone or oxycodone used In combination with alprazolam (a benzodiazepine) and carisoprodol. According to the Florida Medical Examiner's Office, they have seen a 127% increase in the number of deaths associated with benzodiazepines in the State of Florida between 2005 and 2010.    On July 1, 2011, the State Health Officer and Surgeon General, Dr. Frank Farmer issued a statewide public health emergency declaration In response to the ongoing problem of prescription drug abuse and diversion in Florida. The press release accompanying this emergency declaration noted more oxycodone is dispensed In the state of Florida than in all remaining states combined. It further stated that in 2010, ""98 of the top 100 doctors dispensing Oxycodone nationally were in Florida""; and that ""126 million oxycodone pills were dispensed through the top 100 dispensing pharmacies in Florida"".    5     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1965-17  Filed:  07/23/19 23 of 56.  PagelD #: 167077    Following changes in Florida law aimed at curbing the problematic dispensing direct from the pain clinics, drug abusers have found other ways to obtain oxycodone and other ""cocktail"" drugs. Rather than dispensing the drugs directly to ""patients,"" pain clinics and complicit doctors are now forced to write prescriptions for oxycodone and other abused drugs. Drug abusers wanting their prescriptions filled must take their prescriptions to a retail pharmacy. The result was that law enforcement saw immediate and significant increases in the volume of oxycodone dispensed from retail pharmacies across the state of Florida. Retail pharmacies are generally supplied by a DEA-regi stored wholesale distributor. The doctors and clinics that prescribe oxycodone inappropriately, the pharmacies that dispense their prescriptions, and the wholesale distributors who supply them have caused, and continue to cause, millions of dosage units of oxycodone to be diverted for unlawful use thereby creating an imminent threat to the public health and safety.    Deputy Assistant Administrator Rannazzisi will authenticate and describe the purpose behind three letters sent by DEA to all distributors and manufacturers, including Respondent, on September 27, 2006, February 7, 2007, and December 27,2007. These letters explained to distributor registrants their obligations to maintain effective controls against diversion and report suspicious orders as part of their duties within the closed system established by the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). He will describe the purpose of the suspicious order requirement of 21 C.F.R. �1301.74(b) and its relationship to the statutory obligation of all distributors to maintain effective controls against diversion of controlled substances pursuant to 21 U.S.C. �� 823(b)(1) & 823(d)(1). Consistent with the guidance of these letters, he will describe a distributor's obligation to devise and implement an effective system to identify suspicious orders and the obligation to report suspicious orders to DEA as they are discovered. He will further testify that    6     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1965-17  Filed:  07/23/19 24 of 56.  PagelD #: 167078    a distributor has an obligation under the statutory and regulatory scheme to determine the legitimacy of any order it identifies as suspicious prior to fulfilling that order.    He will further testify that distributors have a statutory obligation to exercise due diligence to avoid filling suspicious orders that might be diverted into other than legitimate medical, scientific and industrial channels and that the exercise of this obligation requires a distributor to confirm the legitimacy of all orders prior to filling. He will describe the general ways in which distributors commonly perform and document this due diligence and will describe common indicators of diversion that all distributors should be alert to at their customer pharmacies. He will testify that these obligations apply equally to distributor registrants regardless of whether their customers are independent or chain pharmacies and regardless of whether the distributor and its customers are under common ownership.    Based on the evidence of its' suspicious order program provided by Respondent, he will testify that the Walgreen Co.'s suspicious order program fails to comply with Respondent's obligations under 21 C.F.R. �1301.74(h). He will testify that the ""Suspicious Control Drug Orders"" report provided to DEA on Respondent's behalf monthly by Walgreen Co. corporate headquarters constitutes nothing more than a monthly report of completed transactions and therefore does not meet the regulator}' requirement to report suspicious orders as discovered, as is spelled out in his December 27, 2007 letter to Respondent. In other words, despite the title attached to these compilations of completed transactions, he will testify that they are not suspicious order reports under the regulation. Furthermore, he will testify that based on the documents provided by Walgreen Co., Respondent appears to have conducted little to no investigation or analysis of the orders it reported as suspicious prior to completing the sale of these orders, despite the fact that on a single day, many of these orders greatly exceeded the    7     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1965-17  Filed:  07/23/19 25 of 56.  PagelD #: 167079    monthly threshold established by Respondent for reporting orders of a particular controlled substance as suspicious.    Moreover, he will testify that the monthly reports of completed ""suspicious"" transactions reported by Respondent were misleading In that they did not report each order received and shipped by Respondent, but instead aggregated the orders shipped on any given day. Further, he will testify that the reports made by Respondent are flawed in that they include all orders for a particular controlled substance shipped to a particular pharmacy in a given month and do not indicate which of these orders are being reported as suspicious. He will testify that based on the foregoing, Respondent did not make a single proper suspicious order report, despite a history of supplying its customers, particularly but not limited to its Florida retail pharmacies, incredibly large amounts of the most commonly abused and diverted controlled substances.    He will testify regarding the Walgreen Co.'s current suspicious order policy, applicable to all of its distribution centers, including Respondent, which indicates that as of January 1, 2012, the company will no longer make suspicious order reports as a result of a system that supposedly prevents shipment of any suspicious orders. He will testify that such a policy evidences a misunderstanding of the suspicious order reporting requirement, which is triggered by suspicious orders for controlled substances, not only when such an order is actually shipped. He will testify that this operating statement on behalf of Respondent is further evidence of the lack of an appropriate system under 21 C.F.R. � 1301.74(b) and is indicative of ineffective controls against the diversion of controlled substances.    Finally, he will discuss the additional requirements imposed upon the Walgreen Go's operation of its retail pharmacies by the Memorandum of Agreement entered into between DEA and Walgreen Co. in April, 2011.    8     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1965-17 Filed: 07/23/19 26 of 56.  PagelD #: 167080    2.   Susan Langston, Diversion Program Manager (""DPM""), Miami Field Division    (MFD)    DPM Langston will testify to her background, education and training as a DEA Diversion Investigator, Diversion Group Supervisor, and Diversion Program Manager. She will testify substantially as follows:    Since at least 2009, the State of Florida has been the epicenter of a notorious, well-documented epidemic of prescription drug abuse. In July 2011, the Florida Surgeon General declared a Public Health Emergency based on the prescription pill epidemic which results in an average of seven overdose deaths per day in Florida. The controlled substances most commonly associated with this epidemic are typically prescribed at unscrupulous pain clinics by physicians acting outside the usual course of professional practice and include Schedule II pain relievers, such as oxycodone (which is highly addictive and known to be highly abused an diverted in the State of Florida); Schedule IV benzodiazepines, such as alprazolam; and Schedule IV muscle relaxers, such as carisqprodol. Frequently, these controlled substances are prescribed in large amounts and in combination with each other as ""cocktails"" popular with drug seeking individuals. According to the 2010 Florida Medical Examiner's Commission Drug Report, the drag that caused the most deaths in the State of Florida for 2010 was oxycodone (1,516 deaths), followed by benzodiazepines (1,304 deaths of which 981 were caused by alprazolam). DPM Langston will testify regarding changes to Florida law aimed at curbing this problem that restricted the ability of practitioners to dispense controlled substances to patients and how the epidemic of controlled substance drug abuse and diversion has now shifted to pharmacies.    DPM Langston will explain why Respondent and 6 of its retail pharmacy customers were targeted for investigation. She will testify about statistical information compiled by DEA's    9     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1965-17  Filed:  07/23/19 27 of 56.  PagelD #: 167081    ARCOS (""Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System"") unit, identifying the largest distributors of oxycodone and related controlled substances in Florida, as well as the largest retail pharmacy purchasers of these substances in Florida from 2008 to the present. She will introduce charts showing these pharmacies' oxycodone purchases from at least 2008 to the present and describe why the size and frequency of these purchases should have created suspicion within Walgreen Co. and Respondent that these pharmacies were diverting controlled substances.    She will testify that on August 19,2011, DEA met with Walgreens personnel at the DEA MFD offices in Weston, Florida to apprise them of relevant ARCOS information about Walgreens' sales of oxycodone In Florida.   Present from Walgreens were Dwayne Pinon (corporate in-house counsel), Ed Forbes (Market Loss Prevention Director), Wesley Rohn (Pharmacy District Supervisor), Joan Bustelo (Pharmacy District Supervisor), Anne-Marie Aldrich (Pharmacy District Supervisor), Cesar Cedeno (Pharmacy District Supervisor), Georgia Lehoczky (Market Pharmacy Director), Robert Espinosa (Pharmacy Supervisor), Lakeisha Axem (Pharmacy Supervisor), Sandra Vazquez (Pharmacy Supervisor) and Susan Thompson, Loss Prevention Manager. She will testify that the Walgreens officials at this meeting were told, amongst other things, that 20 Florida Walgreens pharmacies were in the top 300 of oxycodone purchasers in the United States for the first half of 2011 and within the State of Florida over the same time frame, 100 of the top 300 pharmacy oxycodone purchasers were Walgreens retail pharmacies. Moreover, Florida Walgreens pharmacies purchased more than double the average amount of oxycodone purchased by Florida pharmacies.    DPM Langston will discuss the ""Suspicious Control Drug Order"" reports received by DEA from Walgreens. She will testify that these reports were sent to DEA from Walgreens Loss    10     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1965-17 Filed: 07/23/19 28 of 56.  PagelD #: 167082    Prevention officials at corporate headquarters in Illinois on behalf of the Jupiter Distribution Center. She will discuss the contents of these reports, how frequently they were submitted, and what DEA was able to glean from an examination of these reports. DPM Langston will testify that the reports were not in compliance with DEA's clear edict regarding what should and should not be contained in a suspicious order report. She will also testify that in 2012, DEA has not received a single suspicious order report from either Walgreens Corporate Headquarters or from the Jupiter distribution center.    DPM Langston will discuss the execution of Administrative Inspection Warrants (AIW), on April 4, 2012 at six Walgreens pharmacies and Respondent, along with the service of an administrative subpoena for additional records from Respondent, the six pharmacies, and their corporate headquarters. She will testify regarding the meaning of the subpoena's request for ""due diligence"" files and her efforts to communicate this concept to Respondent. Further, she will testify' to the types of information traditionally found within such files maintained by distributor registrants and the traditional steps distributors undertake to monitor their customers and assess whether or not they are involved in diversion.    She will also introduce emails produced by Walgreens in response to the subpoena, in which the corporation urges its Florida pharmacy supervisors to increase their oxycodone sales and she will discuss other emails Indicating that Walgreens"" officials were aware of excessive dispensing at some of these 6 pharmacies, all of whom received their Schedule II controlled substances from Respondent.   She will discuss Walgreen Co.'s dispensing guidelines for Its Florida pharmacies and the development and results of a survey entitled ""Focus on Compliance"", the purpose of which was to assess the scope of the diversion problem at Walgreen's Florida pharmacies.    11     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1965-17  Filed:  07/23/19 29 of 56.  PagelD #: 167083    DPM Langston will testify' about multiple specific suspicious orders placed by the six related Walgreens pharmacies during 2011, which were filled despite their suspicious nature and without Respondent conducting any due diligence to ensure these orders were not being diverted. DPM Langston will discuss the specific order dates, the objective suspicious factors related to the orders, such as size and quantity, as well as the subjective factors creating a situation in which Walgreens knew or should have known that the orders were suspicious and that these pharmacies' dispensing practices posed an unreasonable risk of diversion. DPM Langston will discuss due diligence steps that could have and should have been taken before the distribution center shipped the orders. She will also describe numerous ""red flags"" of diversion evident from a review of the records available to Respondent from the individual pharmacies It served, 3.   Office of Diversion Control, Unit Chief Kyle Wright    Mr. Wright will testify to his background, education and training as the Targeting and Analysis Unit Chief in the Office of Diversion Control. He will further testify' as follows:    Mr. Wright will testify regarding the Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System (""ARCOS"") data regarding Respondent's sales of controlled substances. He will testify to the background of ARCOS, its purpose, the information ARCOS contains, and how the information is used by DEA to identify potential diversion of controlled substances. He will testily that he used ARCOS information to conduct an analysis of Respondent's sales of controlled substances. Specifically, he will testify with respect to the ARCOS information for Respondent's top six retail phannacy customers. Wright will further authenticate charts showing comparative levels of controlled substance purchases among Respondent's various retail chain customers from 2008 to the present, to include the average oxycodone purchasing by all of Respondent's customers; its Florida customers; and the six targeted Walgreens pharmacies.    1.2     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1965-17 Filed: 07/23/19 30 of 56.  PagelD #: 167084    Wright will further testify to the importance of accurate and complete reporting to ARCOS and will testify that a distributor who reports in a manner that consolidates multiple orders under separate DEA Forms 222 into a single Form 222 is not making a complete and accurate report. Wright will authenticate documents showing Respondent's ARCOS reporting on a number of occasions and compare this reporting to the actual sales information from the source documents.    4.  Acting Group Supervisor (""A/GS"") Donna Richards    A/GS Donna Richards will testify to her background, education and training as a DEA Diversion Investigator and Group Supervisor. She will testify substantially as follows:    A/GS Richards conducted a thorough review of the materials provided by Walgreens in response to the administrative subpoena issued by DEA.   She will testify that her review of these documents produced no actual showing of any due diligence exercised by Respondent to verify the legitimacy of their increasingly frequent and large orders for highly abused controlled substances. The one exception A/GS Richards will note are several emails from the Jupiter distribution center CII Function Manager, Christine AtwelL questioning the size and frequency of orders from particular pharmacies. Richards will testify that despite Respondent's apparent concern about the orders it was fulfilling on behalf of these pharmacies, Respondent continued to ship suspiciously large quantities of controlled substances to these pharmacies and did not properly report any of the orders that Atwell questioned, or that were subsequently shipped to these phannacies as suspicious. Richards will testify that based on the Walgreen Co.'s response to DEA's request for due diligence files, Respondent filled these orders without adequately resolving AfwelFs concerns or otherwise conducting any investigation of these orders to determine that they were not being diverted.     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1965-17  Filed:  07/23/19 31 of 56.  PagelD #: 167085    Richards will further testify about several particular incidents occurring at Respondent's customer pharmacies that should have increased Respondent's scrutiny of these customers, all of whom were already purchasing unusually large quantities of the most commonly abused and diverted controlled substances. One of these incidents occurred in December 2010, at Walgreens store 03629 in Hudson, Florida. An individual attempted to fill a prescription for 270 thirty milligram oxycodone tablets but abruptly left the pharmacy without the narcotics he was seeking after apparently learning that pharmacy personnel, who had reviewed the prescription and suspected it was a forgery, had contacted law enforcement. Despite being put on notice that this customer was likely diverting, Walgreens 03629 continued filling prescriptions for the customer through October 2011. All of the prescriptions were for oxycodone, hydromorphone and/or alprazolam, were paid for in cash and issued by physicians located a significant distance from Walgreens 03629.   She will further testify that efforts by Walgreens to impose order limits on this particular store in light of its problematic dispensing did not succeed.    Similarly, Richards will testify that on September 27,2010, a pharmacist at Walgreens store 04727 in Ft. Pierce, Florida, reported to local law enforcement that he mistakenly provided an extra 120 dosage units of oxycodone 15mg to a customer. The phannacist stated that when he spoke to the customer's girlfriend to request the return of the oxycodone, the girlfriend said that the customer was an addict who sold his pills and viewed the extra prescription as a ""pot of gold."" Despite this incident, Walgreens 04727 continued to fill this customer's prescriptions for oxycodone 15mg and oxycodone 30mg on December 30, 2010 and January 26,2011.    On November 4, 2010, a Walgreens 04727 pharmacist reported to local law enforcement that she dispensed a prescription for 60 dosage units of oxycodone 15mg to a customer. The pharmacist witnessed the customer hand the prescription to a female in the store. The female    14     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1965-17  Filed:  07/23/19 32 of 56.  PagelD #: 167086    entered the restroom with the prescription and upon leaving the restroom, left evidence (aluminum foil with bum marks and pill residue) indicating that she had used the oxycodone in an illicit manner. Despite this incident, Walgreens 04727 continued to fill the customer's oxycodone and alprazolam prescriptions on November 30, 2010, December 13,2010, December 27, 2010, and January 24, 2011. Additionally, on two of these occasions, the pharmacist noted on the prescription that the customer did not have identification and/or a passport.    On October 28, 2011, the Sheriff of St. Lucie County notified Walgreens 04727 by letter that it needed to take action to stem the tide of prescription drug diversion. St. Lucie County Sheriff Ken Mascara requested Walgreens 04727's ""help in dealing the with prescription painkiller epidemic"" In St. Lucie County and Florida by ""closely scrutinizing"" prescriptions for Schedule II narcotics, written by out-of-town physicians and/or written for out-of town individuals. Nevertheless, Walgreens 04727 continued its practice of filling numerous opiate/opioid prescriptions issued by out-of-town physicians through early 2012. Several of these out-of town physicians subsequently surrendered their registrations for cause and/or were subject to state action for their conduct involving controlled substances prescriptions.    She will also provide additional examples of orders for controlled substances received by Respondent that, given the information available to the Walgreen Co., including the above-related police incidents and the below-summarized testimony of Oviedo Police Chief Chudnow, should have been considered suspicious. She will provide testimony that despite clear ""red flags"" of diversion at some of its customer pharmacies, the distribution center shipped suspicious orders to these phannacies without executing any due diligence to resolve the potential for diversion.    15     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1965-17 Filed: 07/23/19 33 of 56.  PagelD #: 167087    5.   Diversion Investigator (""DI"") Phyllis Garrett    DI Phyllis Garrett will testify to her background, education and training as a DEA Diversion Investigator. She will testify as follows:    A review of the ARCOS information reported by the Jupiter distribution center to DEA revealed failures to report complete and accurate information to ARCOS. Specifically, DI Garrett will point to examples where Walgreens reported a single ordered quantity of Schedule II controlled substances, while the actual amounts were ordered over several DEA 222 forms, amounting to several separate transactions Instead of one. DI Garrett's testimony, along with that of Kyle Wright, will be used to admit documents showing these failures to report completely and accurately.    She will introduce evidence of particular shipments of 30mg oxycodone to the six pharmacies named in the Order to Show Cause and will describe the characteristics of these orders that should have triggered both a suspicious order report and additional investigation from Respondent prior to shipping.    6.   Oviedo Chief of Police Jeffrey Chudrtow    Chief Chudnow will testify about his background, training and experience as a police officer and as the Chief of Police for Oveido, Florida. Chief Chudnow- will testify about the very tangible effects that the diversion of controlled substances has had on the city of Oveido, as evidenced by increases in, among other things, crime rates and overdoses. Chief Chudnow will testify about his department's knowledge of Walgreens 06997, as well as another Walgreens within the city limits, as centers for illicit controlled substance sales and use.    The Oveido Police Department (OPD) made numerous arrests for illegal distribution of    16     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1965-17  Filed:  07/23/19 34 of 56.  PagelD #: 167088    controlled substances in 2010 and 2011 related to controlled substances dispensed at the two Walgreens pharmacies, wdth many of the illicit transactions preceding these arrests occurring in the parking lots of the stores. Chief Chudnow will testify that it was his practice following one of these arrests to send a letter to the pharmacy which dispensed the controlled substance being diverted, notifying them of the details and asking for the pharmacy's assistance in preventing future diversion. Chief Chudnow sent dozens of these letters, at least five of which will be offered into evidence because, as noted In the ISO, Walgreens Store 06997 continued to dispense to some of these individuals even after being notified of their arrest.4    On February 10, 2011, Chief Chudnow met with Ed Lanzetti, Walgreens Market Loss Prevention Director, and another Walgreens official. At the meeting, Chief Chudnow presented Mr. Lanzetti with numerous statistics and facts regarding controlled substance arrests related to Walgreens' two Oveido pharmacies. These statistics included numbers and types of drug-related arrests, types of controlled substances seized per arrest, and statistics showing the names of doctors whose prescriptions were related to diversion arrests. Despite being given this information, Walgreens 06997 continued to fill prescriptions for these associated doctors subsequent to the February meeting with Chief Chudnow.    On March 15,2011, Chief Chudnow sent letters to Alan G. McNally, Chairman of Walgreens Corporation and to Gregory D. Wasson, President and CEO of Walgreens Corporation, informing them about the numerous controlled substance arrests taking place at the Oveido Walgreens pharmacies and the effects on the community of Oveido, and asking for their assistance in stopping these problems. Chief Chudnow never received any response to his request for assistance from anyone at Walgreens Corporation.    4 DEA will offer the evidence of subsequent dispensing to the subjects of Chudnow's letters through a Diversion Investigator and will specify these individuals and supporting documents in a Supplemental Prehearing Statement, after moving for a protective order concerning the personal information to be disclosed in these exhibits.    17     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1965-17 Filed: 07/23/19 35 of 56.  PagelD #: 167089    7.   Robert Varno    Varno will be asked to testify about his experience as Respondent's Distribution Center Manager in Jupiter, Florida from June 2001 until June 2012. Varno will testify about his responsibilities as the manager of the distribution center, including the filling of orders for all of the Walgreens retail pharmacies serviced by the Jupiter distribution center. Varno will be asked to explain the distribution of controlled substances to the Walgreens retail pharmacies, including the use of DEA Form 222 for filling orders for Schedule 11 controlled substances. Varno will testify regarding his knowledge and use ot shipping Information reported to ARCOS, as well as Suspicious Order Reports, his understanding of their creation and his use of these reports in managing the distribution center. He will discuss how these reports were received and stored at the distribution center, his utilization of these reports, and how these reports impacted shipping operations at the distribution center. Varno will testify about his training in anti-diversion measures by Walgreen's Headquarters and/or Loss Prevention officials, particularly those portions of his training focusing on Florida's well-known epidemic of prescription drug abuse. He will also testify about his own knowledge of the prescription drug problem in Florida and how that awareness impacted operations at Respondent, particularly with regard to identifying and verifying suspicious orders of commonly abused painkillers.    8,   Christine Atweil    Christine Atweil will be asked to testify about her more than six years of experience as the CII Function Manager at the Walgreens distribution center in Jupiter, Florida. Atweil will explain the role of the CII Function Manager as part of the distribution center operations, including her functions while serving In that role. She will explain the system for filling orders for Schedule II controlled substances in place in 2010 and 2011, including the filling of standard    18    CONFIDENTIAL    WAGMDL00387686     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1965-17 Filed: 07/23/19 36 of 56.  PagelD #: 167090    orders, the filling of ""PDQ3"" orders and the filling of orders for a quantity beyond the stock on hand at the distribution center. Atweil will discuss how the Distribution Center handled orders placed directly by pharmacy employees in addition to the automated system. She will testify about the process of reviewing orders for controlled substances received at the distribution center, as well as about the guidance and training she received from Walgreen Co. on how to evaluate special orders. Atweil is expected to testify that she had full approval authority on all special orders placed by pharmacies. She will testify about how the automated system handled DEA Form 222 documentation of orders filled by the distribution center, as well as any controlled substances ordered but not filled by the distribution center.    Atweil will testify regarding her knowledge and use of information reported to ARCOS, as well as Suspicious Order Reports, to include her understanding of their creation and her use of these reports in managing the distribution center's CII functions. She will testify about her training in anti-diversion measures by Walgreen*s Headquarters and/or Loss Prevention officials, particularly those portions of this training focusing on Florida's well-known epidemic of prescription drug abuse. She will also testify about her own knowledge of the prescription drag problem in Florida and how that awareness impacted operations at Respondent, particularly with regard to identifying and verifying suspicious orders of commonly abused painkillers.    As the CD. Function Manager, Atweil will, testify regarding emails she sent to Walgreens corporate personnel, including Barbara Martin and Distribution Center Manager Rob Varno, voicing concerns about the unusual size and frequency of orders being placed by several pharmacies. She will testify' about Walgreens response to those concerns and her awareness of any efforts by Walgreens to address the prescription drug problem both nationally and within    5 PDQ is internal vernacular used by Walgreens for ""Pretty Dam Quick,"" or for orders received daily at the distribution center for fast turnaround outside the regular weekly orders.    19     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1965-17 Filed: 07/23/19 37 of 56.  PagelD #: 167091    Florida.    Atweil will discuss changes to the automated filling systems implemented at the Jupiter Distribution Center in 2012. She will also discuss her understanding of the suspicious order reports produced by Walgreens, including that she has no input into the creation of these reports and she never utilized these reports as part of her role as CII Function Manager at the distribution center. She will testify that during her tenure as the CII Function Manager at the Jupiter distribution center, she has never stopped an order from being filled and distributed.6    9,   Group Supervisor (""GS"") Kathy Federico    GS Federico will testify to her background, education and training as a DEA Group Supervisor. She will testify as follows:    On June 14,2012, GS Federico, of the DEA Milwaukee District Office, spoke with Dwayne Pinon, in-house corporate counsel for Walgreen, Co., in a telephone interview. During the interview, Pinon stated that Walgreens' prior suspicious order reporting system was based on a formula for Pseudoephedrine reporting in the DEA Chemical Handlers Handbook. Pinon stated that the old system automatically reported any orders for quantities above the algorithm's threshold limit. He stated that DEA had informed Walgreens that this algorithm reporting system was outdated and that Walgreens needed to establish their own system for reporting suspicious orders. Pinon stated that the old reports were not suspicious orders, but were in fact just orders that ""bounced off the old reporting system. Pinon informed Federico that Walgreens had Implemented a new system which they hoped to present to DEA at some point. The new system set limits on a pharmacy ordering controlled substances based on their sales history, and    6 Both Ms. Atweil and Mr. Vamo were interviewed by DEA in August, 2012, with counsel for Respondent present The Government reserves the right to present evidence of their statements through the testimony of DI's Richards and/or Garrett, particularly if either or both do not testify at the hearing.    20     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1965-17  Filed:  07/23/19 38 of 56.  PagelD #: 167092    any order over the set limit would trigger an alert to Walgreens Loss Prevention. Loss Prevention would then resolve the order. Pinon stated that any orders that Loss Prevention could not resolve would be reported to DEA. However, he stated that initial implementation of this new version of the Suspicious Order Monitoring System had produced ""thousands"" of allegedly suspicious orders, and was thus still being adjusted to produce different results.    10, George Corripio    George Corripio will testify about his thirty-one (31) years of experience as a pharmacist, and his current position as a Walgreen's Staff Pharmacist at Walgreens #5079 at 2423 Orange Avenue, Ft. Pierce, Florida 34950. Corripio will testify about a brief period in 2011, when he worked at Walgreens #4727, also located In Ft. Pierce, Florida. Corripio will testify as follows:    Unlike the customers at The clientele at Walgreens #4727 was ""heavy CII traffic,"" and that ""80% of the clientele was oxycodone]."" In his professional opinion, the diagnoses did not match the customers, as most of the clientele were young people and most of the diagnoses were for back pain. He felt that most of the customers were not telling the truth. The customers were young, they seemed to all now each other, and they often appeared to be under the influence. Often the clientele would present ""cocktail prescriptions."" On one occasion, a female customer presented a prescription for ten opiates, which is the type of prescription dispensed to a patient suffering from terminal illness.    Corripio will testify about his general discomfort at filling oxycodone prescriptions at Walgreens #4727, and about how supervising pharmacist did not seem bothered by the clientele and offered to fill prescriptions for Corripio that he felt uncomfortable filling. She suggested that as Jong as the pharmacy had a diagnosis code for the prescription, they were fine to fill. When Corripio refused to fill a prescription, the customer would often ask when the female pharmacist    21     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1965-17 Filed: 07/23/19 39 of 56.  PagelD #: 167093    was coming back.

Once received, the Government will use these materials to specify exactly which documents are being used and provide a more detailed exhibit list in subsequent filings.    VII. OTHER MATTERS As this and related matters not currently before the Court are part of an ongoing investigation, the Government requests the opportunity to supplement this Prehearing Statement as necessary with additional witnesses and documentary evidence.   There may also be a need to supplement or revise in response to ongoing litigation brought by Respondent in both the Eastern District of Virginia and the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1965-17 Filed: 07/23/19 42 of 56.  PagelD #: 167096    Pursuant to the Court's Amended Order for Prehearing Statements, the Government's position at this time is that paragraph 20 of the OTSC/ISO is the only portion of the charging document that is solely relevant to the Administrator's findings of an imminent danger to the public health and safety.   While other portions of the OTSC/ISO also support this finding, they are also relevant to the issues to be determined herein, particularly at this stage of the proceeding, where the Government is not yet aware of the particular defenses to be raised by Respondent. VIII. POSITION REGARDING HEARING SITUS    At this time, the Government does not request, a change of location for the hearing, though this position is subject to clarification of the means and method of securing the presentation of testimony by civilian witnesses located more than 500 miles from the site of the hearing. See 21 U.S.C. � 876. This concern would be substantially alleviated should Respondent agree to produce in person any current employee requested in this Prehearing Statement or supplements thereto.    IX. BEST ESTIMATE AS TO TIME REQUIRED TO PRESENT CASE    The Government anticipates requiring no more than four (4) days to present its case-in-chief, exclusive of cross-examination and rebuttal.

PagelD #: 167100    Pursuant to the November 20, 2012 Prehearing Ruling, the Government hereby submits its Supplemental Prehearing Statement.    The Government supplements the proposed testimony of its previously disclosed witnesses as follows:    1.   Deputy Assistant Administrator Joseph Rannazzisi    Both the ISO and the Government's Prehearing Statement refer to three letters issued by Deputy Administrator Rannazzissi. The second of these two letters, dated February 7, 2007, is identical to the first, dated September 27, 2006. The Government therefore will not be referencing the February 7, 2007 letter in its proposed testimony and has removed this document from its exhibit list.    Deputy Administrator Rannazzissi will further testify in response to Respondent's contention in its Prehearing Statement that its suspicious orders program was modeled on guidance from DEA's website. He will testify that Respondent's reliance on this website is misplaced, as it applies to DEA's Chemical Program only and is designed to implement separate statutes and regulations than those involving suspicious orders for controlled substances.    2.   DPM Langston:    Ms. Langston will further testify to her review of the materials provided by Respondent in response to a subpoena request for the distributor's due diligence and customer files. Utilizing her training and experience in investigating manufacturers and distributors of controlled substances, she will testify that she found little to no evidence that Respondent or any part of its vertically integrated corporate structure undertook any efforts to assess the reasonableness or legitimacy of the orders it was shipping to Walgreens stores, despite the fact that it routinely identified these orders as suspicious. (To the extent this testimony is duplicative of that    2    CONFIDENTIAL    WAGMDL00387697     *     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1965-17  Filed:  07/23/19 47 of 56.  PagelD #: 167101    proffered for A/GS Richards, Ms. Langston's testimony on these matters will be in place of Ms. Richards.) Correcting her proffered testimony in the government's Prehearing Statement, Ms. Langston will testify that the last suspicious control drug orders report received by DEA on behalf of Respondent was in February 2012, covering orders through January 2012. 3.   Diversion Investigator (""DI"") Phyllis Garrett:    DI Garrett (or, in the alternative, GS Richards) will additionally testify that Respondent's Suspicious Order Reports frequently failed to fully report all orders that, pursuant to their own criteria, should have been reported as suspicious. She will identify and describe a chart with supporting documentation, showing examples of these failures, some of which also include failures to report orders of Schedule II drugs to ARCOS.   She will similarly identify and describe a summary of orders shipped by Respondent in early 2012, after it adopted a policy of no longer making suspicious order reports on the basis that it would not ship them, that exceeded its 2011 and January 2012 criteria for reporting those orders as suspicious.    DI Garrett (or, in the alternative GS Richards) will identify Walgreens ""Oxycodone Action Plan"" Memo for District 227 and compare the plan's intent to impose immediate order limits on three stores with the actual orders shipped by Respondent subsequent to this plan. 4.   George Corripio    Pharmacist George Corripio will testify that he was temporarily transferred from Fort Pierce Walgreens 5079 to Walgreens Store # 4727, Fort Pierce, Florida, for a brief period in late 2010 (vice 2011 as stated in the Government's Prehearing Statement.)    He will testify to the sharp contrast in clientele and dispensing practices between 4727 and 5079, despite their relative close proximity. He will testify that much of Store #4727's oxycodone customers appeared to be young, healthy individuals, whose appearance did not correspond with the medication they were    3    CONFIDENTIAL    WAGMDL00387698     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1965-17  Filed:  07/23/19 48 of 56.  PagelD #: 167102    seeking or the diagnosis codes he obtained from the offices of the clinics issuing the prescriptions. Many times, the customers seeking the pain medications would arrive in groups who all seemed to know each other and they often appeared to be under the influence of something, which was suspicious to him based on his years of experience as a phannacist. He will testify that the phannacy supervisor, Andrea Cohen, told him that all he had to do to in order to fill a prescription was to get a diagnosis code from the issuing office.   Because of his own discomfort in filling these prescriptions which he readily identified as suspicious, Andrea Cohen offered to fill them for him. He will testify that the offices whose customers presented pain prescriptions at 4727 generally provided the same diagnosis, usually low back pain, and that he observed that if 4727 filled one of these questionable prescriptions, they would soon see several more customers presenting similarly questionable prescriptions. He will testify that many times when he refused to fill these prescriptions, the customers would get angry and ask when the female pharmacist was coming back. He will testify that the majority of these customers paid cash and were encouraged to return to the pharmacy by Supervisor Andrea Cohen, who would offer these customers Walgreens discount cards.   He will testify that he told law enforcement officers that the situation at 4727 with regards to the pill-seeking customers was out of control and that he needed help.    He will testify about an incident he reported to the police after he mistakenly provided extra oxycodone to customer Richard Hanson. Upon trying to call Hanson to tell him to return the oxycodone, Hanson's girlfriend told him that Hanson was an addict who sells his pills. He will be asked about whether there is anything in Walgreens dispensing system to note such an incident in order to flag a customer such as Hanson should he present prescriptions in the future for similar substances.    4    WAGMDL00387699 CONFIDENTIAL     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1965-17 Filed: 07/23/19 49 of 56.

Testimony by VTC:    The Government has moved to exclude the proffered testimony of DEA employees and/or Task Force Officers Amber Baginski, Roberta Goralczyk, William Schwartz and Roger Kemicky, witnesses 19-22 in Respondent's Prehearing Statement. Should the Court deny the Government's motion as to any of these witnesses, we request that they be allowed to testify by VTC.

PagelD #: 167108    person, however, given his position, we request the opportunity to present his testimony by VTC only if some currently unforeseen circumstance requires that he remain in Florida. We similarly request the opportunity to present the testimony of George Corripio by VTC if necessary to accommodate his employment schedule.    2.  Notice of Additional Basis For Revocation:    The ISO and Prehearing Statement allege that Respondent violated federal statutes and regulations by failing to implement a system to properly identify and investigate suspicious orders. The failure to conduct adequate due diligence as part of a distributor's obligation to maintain effective controls against diversion is further alleged as conduct that would render Respondent's registration inconsistent with the public interest under 21 U.S.C. � 824(a)(4). Florida law imposes similar requirements on wholesale distributors to conduct due diligence and develop a program to identify suspicious orders and prevent suspicious transactions. Florida Statutes (FS) 499.0121 (15).   In particular, a wholesale distributor must assess the reasonableness of orders in excess of 5,000 unit doses of any one controlled substance in any one month. FS 499.0121 (15)(b). The Government hereby notifies Respondent that the same evidence and testimony already disclosed may therefore also demonstrate that Respondent has failed to comply with applicable State law under 21 U.S.C. �� 823(b)(2) & � 823(e)(2).    3.  Courtroom presence of Government Expert Witness:    The Government requests that its noticed expert, Prof. Paul Doering be permitted to observe all aspects of the hearing in the event he is called in rebuttal.    4.

Draft date 02-06-08    DISCUSSION DRAFT v.8 - Post 1/31/08    HDMA BEST PRACTICES FOR    CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES (CS)    SUSPICIOUS ORDERS    AND DIVERSION PREVENTION    Introduction    These Business Practices for Controlled Substances and Diversion Prevention have been developed as part of the pharmaceutical distribution industry's commitment to the safe and efficient distribution of drug and pharmaceutical products to the patients who need them. They are consistent with, and further amplify, the distributors' outstanding track record of supporting and implementing initiatives designed to improve the safety, security and integrity of the drug supply. They have been prepared in recognition of the growing problem of misuse of Controlled Substances and of the key role distributors play within the prescription drug supply chain.    While drag wholesale distributors, like all nongovernmental entities, do not have the investigative powers and resources to guarantee that certain products will not reach illicit or illegal markets, they are uniquely situated to perform due diligence in order to help support the security of the controlled substances distribution system.  Even with due diligence, it is not always possible to determine the specific final selling point, or patient use, of controlled substances.    However, rigorous due diligence can aid in providing a greater level of assurance that those who purchase controlled substances from wholesale distributors, intend them to be used for legitimate - and legally acceptable - patient needs. In other words, with such due diligence, it is possible to reduce the probability that controlled substances will reach locations within the supply chain for which they are not intended.    The best practices defined below have been designed to identify facts and information surrounding a controlled substance product order that will aid in determining whether the product will be used for legitimate dispensing purposes.    History    In 1970, Congress enacted into law the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) as part of Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970. The CSA provides the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) within the Department of Justice (DO J) with the legal authority to regulate the manufacture, importation, possession and distribution of certain drugs. An additional federal agency, the Department of Health and Human Service's Food and Drug Administration (FDA), maintains additional regulatory authority over many other aspects of the drug supply chain safety and security. The CSA also created a closed system of distribution for those authorized to handle controlled substances. Since its enactment in 1970, the CSA has been amended several times, including:    CONFIDENTIAL    HDA MDL 000148607     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1965-79  Filed:  07/23/19 3 of 13.

Draft date 02-06-08    The Psychotropic Substances Act of 1978    The Controlled Substances Penalties Amendments Act of 1984    The Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act of 1988    The Domestic Chemical Diversion and Control Act of 1993    The Federal Analog Act    The Methamphetamine Precursor Control Act which was superseded by the Combat    Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005    The regulations outlined in Title 21, United States Code part 1300 to end contain the rales and regulations for all individuals and firms desiring to conduct business in controlled substances. All individuals and firms must he registered with the DEA and are required to maintain complete and accurate inventories and records of all transactions involving controlled substances as well as security for the storage of controlled substances.    One major requirement under the above entitled code places a duty upon distributors to report suspicious orders of controlled substances. Specifically, Title 21, United States Code section 1301.74(b) states that    The registrant shall design and operate a system to disclose to the registrant suspicious orders of controlled substances. The registrant shall inform the/Field Division Office of the Administration in his area of suspicious orders when discovered by the registrant. Suspicious orders include orders of unusual size, orders deviating substantially from a normal pattern, and orders of unusual frequency.    Distribution Industry Commitment to Securing the Supply of Controlled Substances    While distributors have always recognized and followed requirements that registrants identify and report ""suspicious orders"" of controlled substances and listed chemicals, recent concerns about the potential misuse of controlled substances has elevated their awareness, and that of the DEA, and the public, to the need for greater rigor in evaluating the purchase orders for such products. For example, in three public statements to Congressional Committees1 DEA has noted the growing problem of diversion and abuse of controlled pharmaceuticals and has indicated they are taking stronger measures to address them.    Based on the expertise and strong endorsement of our members, the Healthcare Distribution Management Association (HDMA) has developed the following recommendations for meeting and exceeding DEA's expectations. We are confident that implementation of these guidelines will    1 See Testimony provided by Deputy Administrator Joseph T.

I.   KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER    Before opening up a new customer account, it is recommended that the distributor obtain background information on the customer and their business, review the information for discrepancies, and, where appropriate, verify the information. Distributors may tailor this part of their best practices to the type of customer under review. Should they do so, it is recommended that they categorize customers according to the customer's DEA license type: 1) Physician, 2) Retail, 3) Distributor.   The following is recommended:    a. Information gathering    All information should be completed by the owner, pharmacist in charge, or equivalent designee for non-pharmacy customers. All documents providing requested information should he signed by the owner, pharmacist in charge or equivalent designee. It is recommended that the potential customer have the signature notarized or that they sign the questionnaire with the statement: ""/ declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on [date]."" The Information gathering step would include:    Provide potential customer with a credit application    Provide potential customer with a background questionnaire requesting the following    information:    Business background    Customer base    Average number of scripts filled each day    Average number of CS item scripts filled each day    Percent of CD purchases compared to overall purchases    Provide potential customer with the questions recommended by DEA    Request copies of all their state and federal licenses    Certification they are not conducting Internet business and will notify the    distributor before conducting any Internet business    If they are conducting internet business obtain the following information:    How long have they been conducting Internet business    Products they wish to purchase    Quantities of those products they wish to purchase    Doctors who will he writing scripts including DEA & State license    numbers, address, telephone numbers, etc.    NABP VIPPS check Names of individuals authorized to sign DEA Forms 222 Dates of the most recent DEA audit.

Draft date 02-06-08    Identification of physicians, pain management clinics, or other treatment centers that are the potential customers' most frequent prcscribcrs or highest purchasing doctors. It is also recommended that the distributor update the questionnaire(s) periodically, especially if concerns arise during prior investigations.    b. Information Review    After the information is received from the customer, a thorough review is recommended. The review would include:    Verify credit application is complete and carefully review the information submitted    Verify customer background information supplied is complete and carefully review the    information contained    Verify answers to questions recommended by DEA are complete and carefully review the    information contained    Verify the CS schedule their state and federal licenses authorized them to handle    c. Independent Investigation    It is also recommended that the distributor independently investigate the potential customer by seeking the following information about them:    Verify DEA license is current and valid    Verify state license is current and valid    Check with the prospective customer's local DEA office for any information regarding the    potential customer such as DEA actions against them    Check with state oversight authorities including state Boards of Pharmacy (potential    pharmacy customers) and Boards of Medicine (for potential physician customers) to    request further background information, such as state actions against them (some states    may provide readily accessible information through the state's Web site.)    Check the DEA Web site and the Federal Register for any actions against the potential    customer    Complete Goggle search, for example, to determine if any potential Internet business can    he identified    Additional Recommendations and Documentation    It is recommended that    o Individuals selected to develop questionnaires for part (a) and conduct reviews and investigations under parts (b) and (c) above receive appropriate training.

All materials and statements contained in this document are preliminary, will be used for discussion purposes only, and should not be distributed outside of the recipient's own company. Draft date 02-06-08    o  Document all results and retain documentation records.    o  Site inspections arc not required but arc suggested if the distributor believes that further    information about the customer is warranted. o  After completing the Information Review and Independent Investigation, the reviewer    should sign and date the information to indicate that they have conducted a    thorough/complete review, and that the information contained is accurate and complete    to the best of his/her knowledge. o  The distributor may wish to conduct periodic updates and review the information that    the customer initially provides to the distributor. o  The distributor may also maintain an internal list of registrants as a ""do not ship list"".    For example, if the distributor has received reliable information that a pharmacy    knowingly sold controlled substances to illicit Internet pharmacies. [Reviewers: Should    we be this explicit about this point.]    II. SUSPICIOUS ORDER MONITORING    a.  System Design    It is recommended that the distributor develop an electronic system, and accompanying SOPs, to meet the DEA's expectations to ""design and operate a system to disclose to the registrant suspicious orders of controlled substances"". Distributors are encouraged to identify responsibilities for identifying, investigating and reporting potentially suspicious orders based on the decision chart included as Attachment 1 of these Best Practices. Specific elements of the monitoring system are further described below.    b. Identify Product and Customer Characteristics    Separate/classify/group your customers into appropriate/different class of trades. For example, retail pbarmacies, hospitals, doctors, dentists, etc.    Separate the controlled substances the distributor sells into groups or ""families"" of drags. For example, all CS items containing Codeine, all CS items containing Cocaine.    Distributors may use the National Technical Information Service (NTIS) system which identifies each particular CS SKU by NDC number and lists the active ingredient. The term DEA base code or drug code is setup by NDC number. An electronic copy of this information may he used to set averages.    Alternatively, the distributor may choose to identify each family of drags and track the unit dose (tablet) of each SKU.2    "" It should be noted that this method is difficult because of the different strengths of the drugs.    5    CONFIDENTIAL    HDA MDL 000148611     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1965-79  Filed:  07/23/19 7 of 13.

All materials and statements contained in this document are preliminary, will be used for discussion purposes only, and should not be distributed outside of the recipient's own company. Draft date 02-06-08    c. Develop ""Thresholds"" to Identify Order of Interest    ""Thresholds"" for identification purposes may be made by using averages dispensed by the facility consistent with the class of customer.    Calculate the average single order and the average monthly order per ""family,"" per customer, and class of trade. A minimum of six months sales history or a maximum of 24 months sales history is recommended.    Also, identify orders of ""unusual"" size. It is recommended that distributors follow past DEA criteria. Specifically, DEA has recognized three times the average C-II and reportable C-III orders as meeting the unusual threshold. In the past the DEA has recognized eight times the other C-TTT-V orders as meeting the unusual threshold.    Unusual (based on frequency and deviating substantially from a normal pattern) must also be identified to meet DEA requirements.    d.  Stop Shipments of an Order of Interest    Option 1    Stop shipments of the individual drug code product that is an Order of Interest    Neither the individual orders of that specific drag code product order, nor any portion of that entire specific drag code product order that meets or exceeds the thresholds identified above should be shipped. It is recommended that the electronic system contain a process to automatically ""block"" the order or otherwise stop the product from being shipped. They may, however, ship any non-Controlled Substances included with the order or other controlled substances products that did not exceed a threshold as defined in their monitoring system. Distributors may choose to report immediately or may investigate the order as described in III below.    Option 2 - Distributors may ship a portion of the entire individual drug code product that is an Order of Interest    Distributors may determine that, based on the anticipated customer's needs, it would be necessary for them to ship part of the order of the individual drag code product that triggered the thresholds. They may also ship any non-Controlled Substances included with the order or other controlled substances products that did not exceed a threshold as defined in their monitoring system. If they decide to ship part of the drag code product in the order of interest, they should immediately proceed to investigate the order as described in Section III below.    III.

All materials and statements contained in this document are preliminary, will be used for discussion purposes only, and should not be distributed outside of the recipient's own company. Draft date 02-06-08    Should a distributor wish to reconsider and ship an order (or part of such an order) that meets the threshold and is thereby identified as an ""order of interest"", it is recommended that he or she first conduct an investigation of the order to determine whether the order should he reported or if it may he shipped.    a. Designating an Investigator    It is recommended that the distributor designate a person with suitable experience and background to investigate potential suspicious orders. Such criteria as length of service, education/training, and expertise may he factored into the choice of the individual.    b. Elements of the Investigation    If it is determined that the order should be investigated further, it is recommended that the investigation include three elements as described below. Site inspections are not required, hut are suggested if the investigation provides insufficient verification of the order.    Review prior orders    The distributor should review past purchases by the same customer for    trends/discrepancies to determine if:    The distributor had to investigate a prior order ? What was the circumstance of that    investigation? Was this order the same, or how did it differ? There had been an increase (or decrease) in orders for this ""group"" or ""family"" of    products? There had been other unusual activity such as ""spikes"" in their orders? There had been a decrease in orders for other products (potentially indicating a shift    in focus of customer base.) There been a change in the customer's operating environment (such as a new pain    clinic has recently opened in the pharmacy's neighborhood)? There had been a change in availability of drags for pain management (such as a    new drug dosage form that has recently been approved by FDA)? Whether there are end of year C-II quota issues?    Interview customer    Ask: Why is there an ""unusual"" order? What will customer do with it? Who is prescribing    it? (Who, what, when, where, why, how?)    Verify customer input - (where appropriate)    How and what information is to be verified will be determined on a case by case basis, but    examples of information that could be verified include:    If a customer says there is a new pain clinic located nearby, verify clinic's existence, name, address    If the customer says they called DEA, verify that they actually did so    7    CONFIDENTIAL    HDA MDL 000148613     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1965-79  Filed:  07/23/19 9 of 13.

Draft date 02-06-08    If the customer states that a natural disaster destroyed their pharmacy and they must    restock, verify disaster If they claim they ""lost"" a shipment, verify loss    c. Documentation    All investigations should he documented and records retained in an appropriate location within the firm (such as with the customer's records).    At a minimum, documentation should include the name(s), titles(s) and other relevant identification of the purchaser contacted (e.g., ""pharmacist in charge""), dates of contact, and a full description of information provided by the purchaser. A description of the final conclusion of the investigation, including why it was (or was not) deemed ""Suspicious"" by the reviewer, is recommended.   Copies of any written information provided by the purchaser should also be retained.    d.  Shipment Decisions and SOPs    o Decisions to ship an ""order of interest"" should be made by a person specifically authorized to conduct an investigation and release the order.    o Distributors are encouraged to develop an SOP describing how the investigation would he conducted. The SOP should give guidance to the staff conducting the investigation that is reflective of the distributors' and customers' business conditions but allows tbe flexibility to adjust the investigation to tailor it to the individual circumstances that are likely to occur.    e. Shipment and Reporting (under 1301.74(b)) Decision Options    At the completion of the investigation, the distributor decides how to resolve the order. The distributor may find that the order is ""Suspicious"" if:    o  Neither the customer nor the verification steps provided sufficient information to make an informed judgment that the order would likely be distributed/dispensed or otherwise used for purposes that were consistent with the customers' usual course of business. o  Information obtained during the investigation provided reason to believe the product may he used for illegal or illicit purposes, instead of being dispensed consistent with the customers' usual course of business.

FILE SUSPCIOUS ORDER REPORTS WITH DEA    a.   Immediate DEA Notification    Orders with readily identifiable ""suspicious"" characteristics must be reported to DEA upon    identification.    Once the distributor has made the determination the order is suspicious, a phone call to report the order to the local DEA office is recommended to meet the requirement to notify ""when discovered"" (unless DEA provides other direction). Provide additional documentation to DEA upon request.    b. Correspondence for Reporting    It is recommended that all written correspondence with the DEA (containing Suspicious Order reports) should be sent registered mail with a return receipt requested, by electronic mail, or by other system to demonstrate that the DEA has received the notification. Although written correspondence to the local DEA office is encouraged as a follow-up to a phone notification, distributors are encouraged to discuss whether the local DEA office wishes to receive a follow-up written notice and the form for such written communications.    10    CONFIDENTIAL    HDA MDL 000148616     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1965-79 Filed: 07/23/19 12 of 13.

I apologize for any confusion this may cause and hope that we are able to find a date that works best for all.    Regards, Anita    703-885-0240    From: Ducca, Anita    Sent: Tuesday, September 25, 2007 6:24 PM    To: Ducca, Anita    Cc: Pam Ritter (pritter@hdmanet.org)    Subject: HDMA DEA Strategy Meeting - Availability Response Requested by Thursday Sept. 27    TO: RAC and FGAC Committees CC: GPPC    (Also to he provided to Key Contacts of HDMA distributor members who do not current have a representative on one of these Committees)    Dear HDMA Committee Members:    Given the intensity and impact of the Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) recent actions, and the concerns expressed by HDMA's Executive Committee last week, HDMA recommends developing a comprehensive DEA strategy.    CONFIDENTIAL    CAH MDL PRIORPROD DEA07 00877471     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 2350-26  Filed:  08/14/19 3 of 4.  PagelD #: 379767    I'm requesting feedback, by COB this Thursday, September 27 regarding your interest and availability for a 2-day HDMA meeting tentatively to be held on Wednesday and Thursday, October 10 and 11 at HDMA's offices, or a nearby hotel. We would end the second day in the early-mid afternoon to meet flight schedules.    Our initial thoughts are to review the major DEA issues (Suspicious Orders, Methadone, In-Transit Losses, and the Proposed rule to obtain retailers' PSE compliance self-certification), then develop specific policy positions and supporting information for them, as well as an overall strategy for identifying solutions and accessing decision makers. We would also comprehensively assess HDMA's role in future DEA interactions.    Specific topics could include:    �     Potential impacts of a ""voluntarily"" restriction on 40 mg methadone distribution. If we object to a voluntary distribution, on what grounds, are there alternatives, and what strategies can we use to express our concerns? Alternatively, if no one objects, should we communicate that view to the DEA?    �     Similarly for suspicious orders. Are there alternatives we can propose to DEA, or specific objections we should raise? What supporting information exists, can we develop a strategy for DEA's concerns, who should be involved?    �     DEA has stated that if we do not develop business practices for In-Transit Losses, they will issue a regulation. We suggest discussing specific elements of a set of business practices appropriate for wholesale distributors. If there are objections to developing business practices we had not considered before, should we alternatively recommend specific requirements to DEA for their regulation?    �     Discuss the recent proposed rule, DEA's statutory authority to require wholesale distributors to obtain retailers' PSE compliance self-certification number, and potential compliance issues. Discuss points to include in a written response. (The link to the proposal is: http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/01ian20071800/edocket.access.gpo.gov/2007/E7-18530.htm)    �     Develop a strategy for outreach to appropriate decision makers, such as DEA staff, the Hill, other federal agencies who may be supportive, e.g., OMB or the Small Business Administration.    �     What, if any, legal options do we have to address all the above?    �     Other DEA issues that may arise and future DEA strategies, e.g., Should we have regular meetings with DEA? Are there other stakeholders might we jointly work with on these issues?    We will refine this tentative agenda as we hear from you. If there is sufficient interest among our members in this 2-day meeting, we will also invite DEA staff to present their views and answer questions. But strategy discussions would be held after they finish and leave.    Given the need to keep up with DEA's fast pace, we also request that those attending be prepared to fully assess the impacts and are authorized to speak on, and agree to, policy and strategy decisions on behalf of their companies.    If you wish to participate and are available on the tentative dates (Oct. 10 & 11)1 would appreciate hearing from by COB this Thursday, Sept. 27. Please copy my assistant, Pam Ritter pritter@hdmanet.org on your response.   It would also be helpful to tell us if you wish to bring others from your company and how many so we can determine if we'll need hotel space.    If others from your company should see this e-mail, please forward it to them but we ask that you do not circulate this outside your offices, as this is an HDMA distributor member meeting (only). I will let you know shortly after Thursday the results of this request.    I'll be happy to answer questions in the meantime.

It focuses mostly on meetings we had with them and includes an occasional ""one off"" clarification request that we've had, but not our usual rulemaking comment letters.    Please look especially at slides #11 and 12 to see if you can think of anything else. (#13 has the DMC-specific speaking events)    Also, on slide 11, if I recall correctly, you or maybe John G, sent a letter to either Lou or to Chuck asking for a speaker at DMC. I don't have the letter or the date. Do you?    Finally, Michelle Leslie asked for a list of when DEA spoke. Perry is asking her to put together something similar but I think this should do it for both.    Anita    CONFIDENTIAL    HDA MDL 000081363 "

PagelD #: 382263    Tom Twitty    From:    Tom Twitty    Sent:     Thu 12/12/2013 1:45 PM (GMT-05:00)    To:         Dale Smith; Chris Smith    Cc:         Carolyn Webb    Bcc:    Subject: DEA Strategy Task Force Meeting Update    Dale/Chris,    I wanted to provide a brief update on the meeting yesterday at HDMA Headquarters. Full minutes and some homework will be coming out from Patrick Kelly shortly and I will forward that information when received. There were representatives from CAH, ABC, MCK, Mutual Drug and JM Smith along with the HDMA staffers, David Durkin of Olsson Frank Weeda Terman Matz, and Priscilla VanderVeer from APCO    Overall, I thought the dialogue was robust and productive. There were basically three areas of attack identified:    1)  Work on building a coalition effort    -the ""Alliance"" (TEVA, Cardinal, AMA, Prime Therapeutics)    - Explore NCPA effort - Doug Hoy has reached out to John Gray to start discussions on this    - Work on building relationships with NGA and AG's - Possible PSA's to educate media and public about our industry    2)  DEA Specific Issues    - Let Marino/Blackburn bill float as is, but compile internal hot button's for DEA to prepare for blowback -this bill requires a process similar to the FDA's processes for allowing corrective action for violations or issues prior to issuing ISO's, drug testing for associates with access to the controlled drug storage areas (which we already do) and also has requirements regarding defining ""imminent danger to the public""    - Convene a meeting in person to compile industry practices (member specific input to be masked through David Durkin's firm) to address Due Diligence and SOM systems.    - John Gray to attempt to set up a luncheon with Michelle Leonhart, General McCaffery and himself to discuss ways that we can start to build a collaborative relationship - the DEA has refused to come to the table in recent requests    3)  HDMA Branding    - Utilize APCO material to conduct targeted media outreach to educate on value that distributors provide    - Prepare canned HDMA responses to be used when issues like WV and drug shortage issues surface. Rather than making no public statement and letting the public only hear what the media put's out, such as calling us ""pill mills"" with no regard for patient safety.    - Develop PSA's to educate on HDMA and the value we provide.    We also talked about developing and offering a solution suite of ideas that we could offer up to the DEA as a way to show that industry was concerned and open to other creative ways to stem prescription drug abuse. One idea was to create a new licensure type for pharmacies that were certified to dispense certain levels of pain medications that could be tied directly to a certified list of pain physicians.    My sense was that all were pretty passionate about going after this except Cardinal, which I believe was your read after the last EC meeting.    More to come.

Marino and Blackburn. When we met with their offices on hydrocodone, they mentioned their interest in addressing the broader prescription drug issue and this is the product of their work. This is a very early draft, as you will notice legislative counsel has additional questions within the document. Additionally, there is similar language to the draft legislation Senator Boxer has asked for us to review and support.    Marino's office indicated their goals are:    1)    Clarifying existing authorities under the CSA and requiring escalation of enforcement under certain circumstances; and    2)    Some sort of mandated continuing dialogue between industry and DEA.    We are still reviewing the draft internally but wanted to share this with you before the FGAC call tomorrow where we will begin preliminary discussion. Rep. Marino's office is very open to feedback and additional ideas.    Rep. Marino is on the House Judiciary Committee and Rep. Blackburn is on the Energy and Commerce Committee.

The bill will now be sent to the President for his signature. He is expected to sign the bill as all controversy has been resolved.    The bill is one we have been working on with HDMA and NACDS for the past two years. The bill is designed to clarify when DEA can take action against a registrant, and allows for notice to the registrant with the opportunity to take corrective action prior to DEA revoking or suspending a registrant's license. Purdue was very active in influencing the ultimate definition of an ""imminent danger to the public health or safety"".    PPLPC01     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 2357-99  Filed:  08/14/19 3 of 3.  PagelD #: 382344    Below is a summary of the legislation.    Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act    Amends the Controlled Substances Act to define: (1) ""factors as may be relevant to and consistent with the public health and safety,"" for purposes of the Attorney General's determination of whether registering an applicant to manufacture or distribute a controlled substance in schedule I or II is in the public interest, as factors that are relevant to and consistent with the findings of such Act; and (2) ""imminent danger to the public health or safety,"" for purposes of the suspension of such a registration, to mean that in the absence of an immediate suspension order, controlled substances will continue to be distributed or dispensed by a registrant who knows or should know, through fulfilling the obligations of the registrant under such Act, that the dispensing is outside the usual course of professional practice, that the distribution or dispensing poses a present or foreseeable risk of adverse health consequences or death due to the abuse or misuse of the controlled substances, or that the controlled substances will continue to be diverted outside of legitimate distribution channels.    Requires an order to show cause as to why such a registration should not be denied, revoked, or suspended to: (1) contain a statement of the basis for the denial, revocation, or suspension, including specific citations to any laws or regulations alleged to be violated; (2) direct the applicant or registrant to appear before the Attorney General at a specific place and time within 30 days after receipt of the order; and (3) notify the applicant or registrant of the opportunity to submit a corrective action plan on or before such appearance. Requires the Attorney General, upon review of any such plan, to determine whether denial, revocation, or suspension proceedings should be discontinued or deferred for purposes of modifications to such plan. Makes such requirements inapplicable to the issuance of an immediate suspension order.    Directs the Department of Health and Human Services, acting through the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to submit a report identifying: (1) obstacles to legitimate patient access to controlled substances; (2) issues with diversion of controlled substances; and (3) how collaboration between federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies and the pharmaceutical industry can benefit patients and prevent diversion and abuse of controlled substances.

PagelD #: 382409    HDMA CRISIS PLAYBOOK: An Interactive Guide to Crisis Communications    Crisis Communications Guiding Principles    Honesty and transparency are paramount.    At all times, strive to provide accurate and timely information, and communicate as much information as possible with the appropriate stakeholders.    Get the facts first.    Determine the facts, then build the communications strategy,    and only provide information that you know is true and accurate.    Communicate early.    Getting ahead of an issue, or getting your message across as early as possible, is almost always the best way to minimize damage from a negative event.    Communicate frequently.    Refusing to offer information or a comment to media or other stakeholders, especially in response to direct questions, generally causes problems rather than prevents them.    Time is of the essence.    During a rapidly developing situation, it is critical to move    a team.    Express emotion appropriately.    The public demands more than the letter of the law or minimum adherence to regulations.    Address key stakeholders directly.    crisis can head off lasting reputation impact.

Our members work proactively with DEA, local law enforcement and others to investigate potential cases of diversion. Primary distributors exercise due diligence and have processes in place to monitor and report suspicious orders and help ensure that those who purchase controlled substances from distributors intend to dispense them only to patients who need them.    TOUGH QftA    What is HDMA's perspective on the registration suspension? Was this action warranted?    HDMA is not familiar with the particulars of this situation, but we are disappointed    with our industry. Our members are committed to working to address the serious national epidemic of prescription drug abuse and to being part of the solution. Our industry shares a common commitment with the DEA to work toward a safe    ensures controlled substances are only dispensed to the patients who need them.    Prescription drugs are different from illegal drugs and a different mindset is required from DEA and all stakeholders. Collaboration and transparency are critical to preventing diversion and we believe that this type of enforcement is unproductive in solving this complex challenge.    Now that the DEA has taken this action at several facilities, should the public be concerned that beyond the actions of one company, the industry as a whole is not taking appropriate steps to help prevent diversion?    Our members follow rigorous statutory and regulatory requirements to detect and prevent diversion. Every distributor must monitor suspicious orders and report to the DEA if it appears a pharmacy's controlled substances volume or pattern of ordering might signal diversion. All orders of controlled substances must be reported to the DEA's reporting system, ARCOS, which tracks the movement of controlled substances from the manufacturer through distribution to the healthcare provider or retailer responsible for furnishing or admistering the product.    Additionally, HDMA has developed Industry Compliance Guidelines (ICGs) for diversion prevention and the reporting of suspicious orders as part of our industry's    medicines. These ICGs are consistent with, and further extend, the distributors' track record of supporting and implementing initiatives designed to improve the safety, security and integrity of the medicine supply.    committed to working collaboratively to help address the serious national epidemic of prescription drug abuse and to being part of the solution. Although distributors do not dispense drugs directly to patients and do not have access to individual patient information, we share a common goal with doctors, pharmacists, manufacturers,    medicines for patients in need, while keeping prescription drugs out of the hands of individuals who will abuse them.

At this time, we cannot predict the impact that this action could have on the local community. We understand that it is important to carefully balance combatting diversion while at the same time not limiting access to appropriately prescribed medicines for patients or potentially putting legitimate pharmacies out of business. In light of these concerns, HDMA has encouraged DEA to provide greater information sharing and more clarity around distributors' responsibilities for controlled substance monitoring and reporting.    Doesn't the industry have a profit motive to ignore signs of diversion?    No. It is in our members' best interest to ensure the supply chain is secure. Our industry is committed to doing whatever it can to protect patient safety and access    services. Primary distributors help pharmacies, hospitals, nursing homes, clinics and other health providers keep their shelves stocked with the prescription and OTC medicines and health products that patients need every day.

Multiple factors contribute to shortages, and the FDA is currently investigating the causes of this particular shortage. In the past, reduced supplies of raw materials, reduced manufacturer production capacity, and FDA-ordered plant shutdowns have caused shortages. Whatever the root cause, distributors are working to ensure supplies are available to the patients who need them as soon as possible.    I've heard that some distributors are stockpiling the scarce drug and selling it at higher prices� is that true?    HDMA's members are primary distributors and do not condone or participate in the gray market for prescription drugs, nor do they engage in ethically unsound practices such as stockpiling supplies or price manipulation. For the most part, primary distributors purchase a majority of product directly from the manufacturer of a drug and distribute a majority of these supplies directly to the customer. Our members are    Why should distributors have control over drug supplies, if they can't prevent life-threatening shortages?    Primary healthcare distributors do not control the availability of prescription drug    by providing an array of services, including aggregate ordering and inventory management tracking, among others. These capabilities allow us to provide early warning to pharmacies, hospitals and other healthcare providers about potential shortages. In addition, without primary distributors, pharmacies, hospitals and other healthcare providers would have to coordinate deliveries and ordering from thousands    the supply chain and cost billions of dollars for the nation's healthcare system.

The nation's primary healthcare distributors are working with FEMA, the Red Cross and the National Guard on the ground in Seattle to ensure that the people hit by the earthquake and tsunami have access to the lifesaving pharmaceutical and healthcare products they need. Further, through the Rx Response coalition, healthcare distributors are working to identify areas of need and direct supplies to them as quickly as possible.

As the region seeks to recover from this devastating event, we will continue to coordinate with emergency response personnel and ensure that the pharmacies serving shelters and displacement areas are able to provide medications to the people who need them.    TOUGH QftA    How is the industry ensuring continuity of the medicine supply?    We are coordinating with emergency response personnel to identify areas of need and rapidly supplying them with critical healthcare products. Through the Rx Response coalition, we are identifying open pharmacies and directing critical supplies to those locations.    What has the industry done to prepare for this kind of disaster?    We participate in the Rx Response coalition, which develops rapid response protocols for disasters. In addition, our members plan for emergency response scenarios by maintaining strategic supplies of emergency-critical medicines and frequently reviewing disaster response protocols.    Is there a concern that patients will not be able to get their medicines?    The needs of patients with both chronic and acute medical conditions are often a particular concern in the aftermath of a disaster. Because we recognize this concern, we have established strategic relationships with emergency response organizations in order to use the best available information to direct critical supplies in the event of a disaster. We are working with FEMA, the Red Cross and the National Guard on the ground to identify areas of need and direct supplies to them as quickly as possible. We recognize that coordinating responses to disasters can be complex and imperfect, but we are doing everything in our power to get the necessary medical supplies to the people that need them.

Rannazzisi                                                     Barbara J. Bo<^kholdt, Chief    Deputy Assistant Administrator                                      Regulatory Section, ODG    Office of Diversion Control                                            Office of Diversion Control    On September 12, 2012, a meeting was held in Arlington, Virginia at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Headquarters between DEA and Actavis Elizabeth, LLC (Actavis). Representing Actavis were: Nancy Baran, Director, Customer Service, Jason Chung, DEA Manager, John S. Kaldes, Senior Director Engineering & EHS, Michael R. Clarke, Ethics & Compliance Officer, Americas, and Doug Plassche, Managing Director, NJ Solid Oral Dose (SOD). Representing DEA were: Barbara J. Boockholdt, Chief, Regulatory Section; Staff Coordinator (SC) Leonard Levin, Regulatory Section; Dedra Curteman, Office of Chief Counsel, Jason Hadges, Office of Chief Counsel; Christine Sannerud, Chief, Quota Section; Stacy Harper-Avilla, Chief, Quota Unit; GS Andrew Breiner, and D/I Michael Smilek, both from the Newark Division Office. The purpose of the meeting was to address the manufacturing and distribution practices of controlled substances by Actavis. SC Levin stated he would only concentrate on oxycodone 15mg and 30mg tablets for the purposes of this meeting. Actavis holds the following DEA Registrations: RKGT 46806 (Manufacturer, NJ), R0146818 (Distributor, NJ), RB0185579 (Manufacturer, NC), RA0231062 (Manufacturer, FL), RA0419552 (Manufacturer, NJ), RA0419540 (Distributor, NJ), and RA0395675 (Manufacturer, NJ).    SC Levin opened the meeting by stating its purpose was both educational and informative. SC Levin stated he would discuss Actavis' responsibilities under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), their suspicious order monitoring system, their procedures concerning due diligence, knowing their customers, who their customers sell to, and graphs depicting the pharmacies where their products were ultimately dispensed from. SC Levin stated he would be primarily focusing on the distribution of oxycodone 15mg and 30mg tablets by Actavis. SC Levin asked for a representative from Actavis to talk briefly about the firm, their product line, their suspicious order monitoring system and to whom they distribute. Ms. Baran spoke on behalf of Actavis. Ms. Baran stated that Actavis manufactures non-controlled and controlled substances from their locations in New Jersey, North Carolina and Florida. Actavis' corporate offices are located in New Jersey. Ms. Baran stated that as of November 1, 2012, Watson Pharmaceuticals will acquire Actavis and the firm will have a new name. Ms. Baran stated both Actavis and Watson will be applying for new DEA registrations. Watson was not invited to this meeting per Actavis because the acquisition has not yet taken place. Ms. Baran stated Actavis sells some products directly to distributors, but the bulk of their finished products are sent to UPS Supply Chain, which serves as a fulfillment center     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1967-72 FJed: 07/23/19 3 of 142.  PagelD #: 176831    for orders placed with Actavis. Ms. Baran stated Actavis remains the owner of the controlled substances while in the possession of UPS Supply Chain. Ms. Baran stated that UPS Supply Chain has their own suspicious order monitoring system. Almost all of Actavis' controlled substances are sent to the UPS Supply Chain location in Louisville, KY. Actavis ships the order to UPS Supply Chain for processing and distribution. Actavis is the owner of the inventory, not UPS Supply Chain. UPS Supply Chain uses their own DEA registration and reports purchases and sales directly to ARCOS. Ms. Baran explained their charge back system. The system enables Actavis to see who their customers are selling their products to and what they are purchasing. Ms. Baran stated that Actavis is just beginning to review their sales through the charge back system. Ms. Baran stated she has visited UPS Supply Chain and been able to review their suspicious monitoring system. UPS Supply Chain has a staff which monitors any suspicious orders of controlled substances. Value Centric is a firm who stores sales data for Actavis which they can review. Recently, Ms. Baran has gone out to visit their large volume customers, such as Cardinal, McKesson and AmerisourceBergen. SC Levin mentioned to Ms. Baran the significance of ""Knowing Your Customers"". SC Levin stated that the United States (U.S.) consumes more legitimately manufactured controlled drugs than any other country. SC Levin mentioned that 97 percent of hydrocodone that is manufactured is prescribed and dispensed in the United States. SC Levin explained the dramatic increase of prescription drug abuse, which has increased by 400 percent over the past 10 years. SC Levin stated that today more people are abusing prescription medication than are abusing illicit drugs. The abuse of prescription drugs has become a national epidemic.    SC Levin presented a PowerPoint presentation exemplifying the common characteristics and issues associated with the distribution and manufacturing practices by manufacturers and distributors of controlled substances. SC Levin stressed the importance of a manufacturer's due diligence requirements, knowing one's customers, and the detection of suspicious orders. Specifically reviewed were the following:    �    Supreme Court Cases and Immediate Suspension Orders    �    Closed System of controlled substance distribution    �    Establishing the medical necessity for a prescription and/or a distribution to be legal    �    The DEA Internet Policy and the Ryan Haight Act    �    Policies published by the American Medical Association (AMA) and the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB)    �    Review of Suspicious Order requirements of Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations    �    Knowing one's customer    �    Theft and loss reporting    �    Recent News Articles regarding actions taken against CVS pharmacies, Cardinal and Walgreens    �    System to insure the address, controlled substance schedules and expiration date of customers' DEA registrations prior to shipping them controlled substances    �    Recent actions taken by the DEA to suspend or revoke controlled substance registrations of distributors and pharmacies that continue to divert controlled substances into the illicit market    At the conclusion of the PowerPoint Presentation, SC Levin presented graphs documenting the distribution of oxycodone 15mg and 30mg tablets by Actavis Elizabeth, LLC. These distributions were derived from ARCOS reports submitted by Actavis under specific NDC numbers. The graphs revealed a dramatic increase in the sale of oxycodone 15mg and 30mg tablets from 2010 to present with the vast majority being distributed to Florida. The graphs did show a decrease in the amounts of oxycodone distributed in the past six months. SC Levin attributed the decrease to actions taken by DEA in Florida,     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1967-72 F^ed: 07/23/19 4 of 142.  PagelD #: 176832    the Florida prescription monitoring program, administrative action taken by DEA against registrants and meetings such as this one. Chief Boockholdt explained that the manufacturer that produces oxycodone is just as responsible as the distributor and pharmacy for ensuring that these drugs do not end up in the wrong hands. SC Levin thoroughly discussed the problems associated with pain management clinics in Florida, which has directly attributed to the abuse and the diversion of oxycodone. Chief Boockholdt stated that addicts are coming from around the country to Florida and are specifically seeking oxycodone 15mg and 30mg tablets. Chief Boockholdt stated that in Florida eleven people per day are dying from oxycodone overdoses and seven babies are bom each day addicted to opiates. SC Levin discussed the red flags associated with physicians prescribing at pain management clinics and the pharmacies who filled the prescriptions, such as, controlled versus non-controlled drugs, trends in purchasing, types of drugs purchased, quantity of drugs purchased, hours of operation, mainly cash customers, etc. Chief Boockholdt stated that ARCOS data revealed the I                                                              Iwas    distributing very large quantities of Actavis oxycodone 15mg and 30mg to numerous pharmacies in Florida. Some of the pharmacies had purchased well in excess of a million dosage units per year. This is an obvious concern to DEA and must be addressed by Actavis.    The graphs were broken down by year and included 2010,2011, and the first six months of 2012. The graphs revealed that Actavis' oxycodone 15mg. and 30mg tablets are distributed throughout the country, but more is distributed in Florida than almost all of the other states combined. The problem is especially bad in South Florida, specifically Miami Dade, Broward and Palm Beach Counties. Chief Boockholdt stated that Florida's prescription drug laws have traditionally been very lax and because of that and the influx of pain management clinics oxycodone sales went out of control. Chief Boockholdt mentioned that because of the amount of oxycodone prescriptions being written, Florida, specifically South Florida has more pending pharmacy applications than all other states combined. Statistics are now showing this problem is spreading north into Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio and West Virginia. SC Levin stated one of the purposes of this meeting is to bring the wholesaler or manufacturer on board to be part of the solution, rather than contribute to the problem.    SC Levin showed graphs of oxycodone shipped by UPS Supply Chain to the distributors and to the distributors' customers SC Levin advised Ms. Baran that Actavis should send someone from their compliance team to visit pharmacies who were receiving their products in south Florida, in order for them to witness the long lines at pain clinics, out of state license plates, questionable clients, security guard(s) in the parking lots, and signs stating cash payment only. SC Levin and Chief Boockholdt stressed to Ms. Baran and the other Actavis representatives to get to know their customers, visit distribution sites, visit customers of those distributors, check on customers' suspicious order monitoring systems, review due diligence files, and obtain printouts of pharmacies or practitioners who are receiving Actavis products.    Ms. Baran stated Actavis has only recently begun looking at the pharmacies that purchase their products and wants to be involved in working to resolve this problem. SC Levin stated that if their customers refused to provide them with sales information Actavis should consider cutting them off. Chief Boockholdt suggested Actavis determine the percentage of their products being shipped into Florida. SC Levin inquired about the two NDC numbers for both oxycodone 15mg and 30mg tablets in 2011. Ms. Baran stated that two of Actavis NDC numbers was terminated in 2011 and replaced by the two new ones. SC Levin again mentioned the I                                                    I Ms. Baran stated    that I             Idistribution centers purchase oxycodone from Actavis. SC Levin suggested    representatives of Actavis travel to some of the distribution sites, especially the one in I             I to    review their suspicious order monitoring systems. A review ofl~^""^^npharmacies purchases of Actavis products is important. The charts shown at this briefing revealed that some ^^�^^^     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1967-72 Fjjed: 07/23/19 5 of 142.  PagelD #: 176833    pharmacies were purchasing inexcess of 20 times the national average of oxycodone. SC Levin pointed out that ^^~^                       lin Delaware are owned by I             land dispense large quantities of    oxycodone. Chief Boockholdt mentioned that any manufacturer's quota request is based on anticipated need and the fact that the majority of prescriptions dispensed in Florida were not legitimate show that Actavis' quota may be too high. SC Levin asked the representatives from Actavis to take serious look at their quota request, review their suspicious order monitoring system, visit their customers to review their suspicious order monitoring systems as well as their due diligence files, ask to see their customers' top customers for Actavis products, and contact their local DEA Office with any questions or issues. Ms. Baran stated that their sales force has been informed to keep management abreast of what is going on in the field. SC Levin mentioned that sales people are generally on commission and may not be objective when it comes to their accounts purchasing suspicious or unusual orders of controlled substances.    Ms. Baran said that Actavis will do whatever it takes to remain in compliance with the CSA. Ms. Baran stated she will take this information back to Actavis corporate headquarters and begin thoroughly reviewing charge back information, as well as the other data bases. Ms. Baran stated Actavis Compliance personnel plan to visit more of Actavis' customers to review their due diligence records and suspicious order monitoring systems. Ms. Baran stated Actavis wants to ensure to the best of its ability that their products are being properly monitored by Actavis and their customers.    SC Levin explained that the purpose of this meeting was to inform, educate, provide pertinent ARCOS data, discuss national trends, and discuss the pain management epidemic in Florida involving oxycodone. DEA is seeking to partner with drug distributors and manufacturers in resolving this problem. SC Levin did state that if Actayis or any firm who had been briefed was found to have violated the CSA pertaining to what was discussed during the course of this meeting DEA could seek administrative or civil action to remedy the situation. Chief Boockholdt advised the representatives from Actavis that all employees who have access to controlled substances at Actavis should receive training similar to that provided at this meeting today.    SC Levin asked if there were any questions. There were none. The meeting between the Drug Enforcement Administration and Actavis Elizabeth, LLC was concluded.    Attachments:    1.

PagelD #: 176889    NEW DATA REVEAL 400% INCREASE IN SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT ADMISSIONS FOR PEOPLE ABUSING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS White House Bulletin    WASHINGTON - Today, Gil Kerlikowske, Director of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), and Thomas McLellan, Deputy Director of ONDCP, joined Peter Delany, Director of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) Office of Applied Studies, and Michele M. Leonhart, Acting Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), to release a new study showing a 400 percent increase in substance abuse treatment admissions for prescription pain relievers. Governor Jack Markell of Delaware and Chris Kennedy Lawford were also in attendance.    The study, Substance Abuse Treatment Admissions Involving Abuse of Pain Relievers 1998-2008, conducted by the SAMHSA, and based on the agency's Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS) reveals a 400 percent increase between 1998 and 2008 of substance abuse treatment admissions for those aged 12 and over reporting abuse of prescription pain relievers. The increase in the percentage of admissions abusing pain relievers spans every age, gender, race, ethnicity, education, employment level, and region. The study also shows a more than tripling of pain reliever abuse among patients who needed treatment for opioid dependence.    ""The TEDS data released today highlights how serious a threat to public health we face from the abuse of prescription drugs"", said Gil Kerlikowske, National Drug Policy Director. ""The spikes in prescription drug abuse rates captured by this study are dramatic, pervasive, and deeply disturbing.""    ""The non-medical use of prescription pain relievers is now the second-most prevalent form of illicit drug use in the Nation, and its tragic consequences are seen in substance abuse treatment centers and hospital emergency departments throughout our Nation"" said SAMHSA Administrator Pamela S. Hyde, J.D. ""This public health threat demands that we follow the President's National Drug Control Strategy's call for an all-out effort to raise awareness of this risk and the critical importance of properly using, storing, and disposing of these powerful drugs.""    ""The data released today is alarming and shows the tremendous damage being caused by prescription drug abuse all across this country each and every day,"" said DEA Acting Administrator Michele M. Leonhart. ""The effective enforcement of laws regulating the distribution of controlled substances, coupled with their lawful disposal are essential parts of a comprehensive strategy to reduce drug abuse. DEA is committed to being part of the solution, however it will take all of us working together to prevent the tragedies that inevitably come with drug abuse.""    ""This rise in prescription drug abuse is no surprise to the doctors and law enforcement professionals who see its effects in our communities,"" said Governor Markell. ""We have been focused on making sure that health care professionals have the best tools     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1967-72 Filed:  07/23/19 62 of 142.  PagelD #: 176890    available to detect and prevent this kind of abuse before it ruins lives. Delaware's new legislation to authorize a prescription monitoring program is one of those tools and an important component of the President's National Drug Control Strategy.""    ""Our national prescription drug abuse problem cannot be ignored. I have worked in the treatment field for the last 35 years, and recent trends regarding the extent of prescription drug abuse are startling,"" said A. Thomas McLellan, Deputy Director of ONDCP. ""We must work with prescribers, the pharmaceutical industry, law enforcement, and families to help us fight this scourge.""    The National Drug Control Strategy, released in May, outlines several steps to address what Director Kerlikowske calls ""the fastest-growing drug problem in the United States""--prescription drug abuse.    They include    * Increasing prescription drug return, take-back, and disposal programs. Prescription drugs that are commonly abused are often found in the family medicine cabinet, and individuals should get rid of unused or expired prescription drugs to prevent diversion and abuse.    * Educating physicians about opiate painkiller prescribing. The Administration's FY 2011 Budget request proposes funding for a program to train prescribers on how to instruct patients in the use and proper disposal of painkillers, to observe signs of dependence, and to use prescription drug monitoring programs to detect when an individual is going from doctor to doctor in search of prescriptions (also called ""doctor shopping"").    * Expanding prescription drug monitoring programs. Currently, these programs are operating in 34 states. The Administration supports establishment of these programs in every state, and is seeking to ensure new and existing monitoring programs effectively use the data they acquire and share information across state lines.    * Assisting states in addressing doctor shopping and pill mills. Criminal organizations have established thriving businesses of transporting people to states with little regulation to obtain prescription drugs from multiple doctors or from pill mills, which distribute drugs indiscriminately. Federal, state, local, and tribal authorities are working together to address this problem.    * Driving illegal Internet pharmacies out of business.    * Cracking down on rogue pain clinics that do not follow appropriate prescription practices.    The National Drug Control Strategy provides a blueprint for reducing prescription drug abuse. Parents, law enforcement, the medical community, and all levels of government have a role to play in reducing prescription drug abuse.

PagelD #: 176892    U.S. can stop some drug sales at 2 CVS stores: judge    Tue, Mar 13 2012    WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration can stop two CVS Caremark Corp pharmacies from selling potentially addictive drugs in a case involving suspected prescription drug abuse, a federal judge ruled on Tuesday.    U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton vacated a temporary restraining order that had blocked the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)from acting against the two Florida stores suspected of selling doses of the painkiller oxycodone outside legitimate channels.    Walton stayed his ruling until 10 a.m. (1500 GMT) on Wednesday to give CVS Caremark attorneys time to appeal. But the company appealed later on Tuesday. Further details were not immediately available.    CVS Caremark had asked the judge to impose a preliminary injunction that could have blocked the DEA from taking action until an administrative law judge decided the matter later this year.    Walton said he could find no reason to believe the CVS argument that DEA had acted in an ""arbitrary and capricious"" manner in ordering sales suspended or that remedial steps taken by CVS were sufficient.    ""We are disappointed with today's ruling,"" CVS said in a statement. ""Regardless of today's outcome, we remain committed to working with the DEA to do everything we can to reduce prescription drug abuse.""    The litigation stems from the DEA's battle against prescription drug abuse, which has surged in the United States to eclipse abuse of most illicit drugs including heroin and cocaine.    The DEA said in court documents that about 7 million Americans abuse pharmaceuticals made with controlled substances for purposes not related to medicine and that Florida is the center of the growing epidemic.    The federal agency cited state statistics showing a 346 percent increase in overdose deaths related to oxycodone from 2005 to 2010, and an average 11 deaths per day from oxycodone, methadone, hydrocodone, benzodiazepines or morphine.    In a case related to the CVS ruling, Walton last month allowed the DEA to suspend Cardinal Health Inc's license to distribute controlled substances from a Florida facility that serves about 2,700 drug stores or hospitals.    The ruling was later blocked temporarily by a U.S. appeals court. Walton said he expected the appeals court to take the same action on CVS.    The CVS stores are two of four Cardinal customers that DEA has said were inappropriately filling oxycodone prescriptions.    A CVS attorney said the company had stopped oxycodone sales at the two pharmacies. But a Justice Department attorney said suspicious sales had involved other controlled substances.    The DEA charged that between January 2008 and December 2011 the two CVS stores purchased amounts of oxycodone far in excess of normal pharmacy volumes, ignored DEA warnings and addressed the issue only after the DEA acted.    A CVS attorney told the court that the volumes were not out of line for high-volume pharmacies that maintain 24-hour service and argued that remedial steps taken by CVS had eliminated any immediate danger to the community by the time the DEA ordered sales suspended in February.    The case is Holiday CVS LLC v. Justice Department, No. 12-00191.    (Reporting By David Morgan; Editing by Gary Hill)     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1967-72  Filed:  07/23/19 65 of 142.  PagelD #: 176893    DEA: Oxycodone orders by pharmacies 20 times average USA Today.com    Two Florida CVS pharmacies ordered more than 3 million oxycodone pills in 2011, more than 20 times higher than the national average, DEA agents said Monday.    As part of a crackdown on rampant painkiller abuse in Florida, the Drug Enforcement Administration charged a major health care company and the two CVS pharmacies in Sanford, Fla., with violating their licenses to sell the powerful pain pills and other drugs.    ""It's a tremendous amount, way beyond what would be for legitimate use,"" said Mark Trouville, DEA special agent in charge of the Miami Field Division. ""We're not talking about a gray area here.""    The average pharmacy in the United States ordered about 69,000 oxycodone pills in 2011, the DEA said. The two CVS pharmacies, located less than 6 miles apart, ordered 3 million.    It is the first time the DEA has suspended the license of a chain pharmacy in Florida for its alleged role in the state's prescription drug abuse problem, Trouville said. The DEA had previously targeted pain clinics known as ""pill mills"" where rogue doctors prescribe thousands of pain pills with only cursory examinations.    ""This is absolutely not the end of this investigation,"" Trouville said. ""We knew when we hit the pill mills that pharmacies would be the next issue. We just didn't know chain pharmacies would get into it.""    CVS said it took steps with DEA's knowledge to stop filling prescriptions from doctors thought to be prescribing improperly.    ""We informed a small number of Florida physicians that CVS/pharmacy will no longer fill the prescriptions they write for Schedule II narcotics,"" spokeswoman Carolyn Castel said in a written statement. ""Distributions of oxycodone to the two Florida stores have decreased by approximately 80% in the last three months compared to the prior three months � we believe in large part due to our action.""    On Friday, the DEA on suspended Cardinal Health's controlled substances license at its Lakeland, Fla., distribution center after linking it to high-volume orders of pain pills to four Florida pharmacies, including the two in Sanford. The distribution center services 2,500 pharmacies in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.    A federal judge temporarily halted the suspension after Cardinal said it would stop supplying the drugs to the four pharmacies. A hearing on the suspension order was set for Feb. 13 in Washington, D.C.     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1967-72  Filed:  07/23/19 66 of 142.  PagelD #: 176894    Cardinal CEO George Barrett called the DEA action a ""drastic overreaction"" and said the company has ""extensive processes"" to prevent diversion of its pharmaceuticals for illegitimate use. Cardinal's internal controls have flagged more than 160 pharmacies in Florida and 350 pharmacies nationwide for ""suspicious order patterns,"" he said.    ""The needs of pharmacies are varied, and higher volumes can be appropriate based on a number of factors, including pharmacy size, hours of operation, patient demographics, and proximity to hospital and surgery centers, nursing homes, cancer clinics and hospice providers,"" Cardinal said in a statement.

PagelD #: 176895    DEA moves against two Florida pharmacies, distributor over pill sales CNN.com    (CNN) - Agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration raided two CVS pharmacies    in central Florida over the weekend, removing controlled substances and suspending    the stores' ability to handle or distribute drugs such as painkillers oxycodone and    hydrocodone.    The DEA said that during one year, the two pharmacies � both in Sanford, Florida -    ordered more than 3 million oxycodone units from a pharmaceutical wholesaler, while a    typical pharmacy orders 69,000.    ""Each registrant (pharmacy) was filling prescriptions far in excess of legitimate needs of its customers,"" said DEA Special Agent in Charge Mark Trouville during a press conference Monday in central Florida.    The DEA also has suspended the controlled-substance license of the wholesale distributor, Cardinal Health of Lakeland, Florida, according to Trouville.    ""Cardinal Health did not fulfill its due diligence to insure controlled substances were not diverted into other than legitimate channels,"" Trouville said.    On Friday, Cardinal Health filed and received an emergency injunction from a federal judge in Washington allowing the drug supplier to continue filling orders for other pharmacies.    ""We believe the DEA is wrong,"" said Cardinal Health Chairman and CEO George Barrett in a written statement.    ""We strongly disagree with the allegations the DEA has made against our facility and intend to vigorously challenge this action,"" said Barrett.    The two Sanford pharmacies remain open filling regular prescriptions but they cannot fill prescriptions for controlled substances such as oxycodone, one form of which is the well-known narcotic OxyContin.    CVS said in a written statement that the company is disappointed by the DEA actions but is fully cooperating with the DEA suspension.    ""CVS/pharmacy is unwavering in its compliance with and support of the measures taken by federal and state law enforcement officials to prevent drug abuse and keep controlled substances out of the wrong hands,"" said CVS spokesman Mike DeAngelis.    Hearings on the suspensions will be held but no date has been set.    Trouville said that since the state of Florida moved to crack down on ""pill mills"" by banning doctors from directly distributing controlled narcotics, pharmacy sales of controlled substances have skyrocketed.

Hernandez    StaffWriter    Federal drug authorities raided two CVS stores in Seminole County on Saturday, removing boxes of medication and othermaterials from the pharmacies.    CVS spokesman Michael DeAngelis said the raid was related to action a day earlier by the Drug Enforcement Agency against Cardinal Health, which has a drug-distribution center in Lakeland.    The DEA tried to suspend the license of Cardinal Health in order to stop the. company from shipping drugs such as oxycodone and hydrocodone from the Lakeland. center. But a judge blocked DEA's order.    In a statement released Friday, Cardinal, a billion-dollar pharmaceutical company, said it distributes drugs to more than 2,500 pharmacies in the Southeast, including four pharmacies listed in the DEA's order, that are accused of filling prescriptions for purposes other than for legitimate medical reasons.   .    Agents on Saturday first raided the CVS pharmacy at 3798 Orlando Drive in Sanford, and then removed boxes from another CVS pharmacy at 5198 W. First St in Sanford.    About a dozen DEA agents worked, for hours at each location packaging items from behind the pharmacy counter while CVS employees went about their* business helping customers fill prescriptions.    ""We are disappointed that the DEA has taken administrative action to prohibit two CVS/pharmacy stores in Florida from dispensing controlled substances,"" DeAngelis said in a statement Saturday.  '    The raids come amid aggressive action by the DEA against businesses accused of dispensing suspicious prescriptions for powerful-pain killers and anti-anxiety drugs.    Cardinal Health said it has cooperated with the agency and has stopped shipping . to more than 160 Florida pharmacies in the past four years.    . ""We believe the DEA is wrong,"" Cardinal chairman and CEO George Barrett said in a statement He added that the company has ""extensive processes to help prevent those medicines from felling in the wrong hands.""

And the number of powerful narcotic pills sold by Florida pharmacies � and doctors dropped from 622 million in 2010 to 498 million last year,    CVS emphasized its role in that effort, saying oxycodone distribution at the two stores raided Saturday have ""decreased by approximately 80 percent in the last three months compared to the prior three months � we believe in large part due to our action.""    arehernandez@tribune.com or 407-420-S471         �    �    2A       MONDAY, FEBRUARY 6,2012    USA TODAY    DEA charges 2 Ha. phannaeies in pill mill probe    Ding wholesaler also under investigation    By Donna Leinwand Leger USATODAY    .    Federal authorities have expanded their crackdown on painkiller abuse, charging a major health care company and two CVS pharmacies in Florida with violating their licenses to sell powerful pain pills and.other drugs.    The Drug Enforcement Administration linked Cardinal Health to unusually high shipments of the controlled drugs to. four pharmacies.    On Friday, the DEA suspended Cardinal's controlled substances license at its Lakeland, Fla, distributibn center/which services 2,500 pharmacies in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.

In its suspension order, fee DEA alleges that Cardinal knew or should have known that.fee four retail pharmacies' had purchased far more drugs than it needed to fulfill legitimate prescriptions.

PagelD #: 176898    Cardinal Health settles drug distribution case USA Today May 16, 2012    The DEA suspended Cardinal Health, the country's second largest drug distributor, from selling and shipping powerful painkillers and other drugs from its Lakeland, Fla., facility for two years as part of a settlement reached Tuesday.    The Drug Enforcement Administration sought to revoke Cardinal's license in February, accusing the company of selling excessive amounts - more than 12 million oxycodone pain pills - to four Florida pharmacies over three years. The DEA said the company did not report suspicious orders or visit the chain pharmacies that purchased large amounts of the drugs.    The DEA also suspended controlled substances licenses for two CVS pharmacies in Sanford, Fla., which purchased millions of oxycodone pills from Cardinal. A judge is expected to rule on the CVS case this month.    ""Cardinal Health is not above the law,"" said Joe Rannazzisi, DEA deputy assistant administrator. ""With this agreement, it admits that it neglected its vital responsibility to prevent the diversion of controlled substance medications.""    While the agreement resolves the licensing issue, the DEA said it may pursue civil penalties^ including fines, against the company. The Dublin, Ohio-based company had revenue of more than $100 billion in 2011.    This is the second time the DEA has taken action against Cardinal. In 2008, Cardinal paid a $34 million fine after the DEA accused it of shipping excessive amounts of hydrocodone, another powerful painkiller, to Internet pharmacies. As part of that settlement, the DEA suspended licenses at three distribution facilities for a year.    Cardinal admitted Tuesday it had ""inadequate"" control over some of its controlled drugs and had not fully complied with the 2008 agreement.    ""This agreement allows us to put this matter behind us, and just as important, will clear the way for a more productive dialogue about how we and others in the health care and regulatory community can work together to prevent the abuse and misuse of prescription drugs,"" Cardinal CEO George Barrett said.    The five-year agreement applies to all 28 of Cardinal's distribution facilities and requires the company to review orders for the controlled drugs, visit pharmacies to look for signs of diversion and hire extra field inspectors for Florida pharmacies.    The Lakeland facility can still distribute non-controlled drugs and medical supplies.     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1967-72  Filed:  07/23/19 71 of 142.  PagelD #: 176899    Cardinal Plant Can't Ship Pain Pills    Wall Street Journal    A U.S. appeals court ruled Friday that a Cardinal Health Inc. distribution hub in Florida can't ship prescription painkillers while the company battles a Drug Enforcement Administration move to suspend that facility's license.    While the appeals court recently issued a stay of the DEA's enforcement efforts against Cardinal's Lakeland, Fla., facility, the court Friday said Cardinal hasn't met the ""stringent requirements for an injunction."" The decision means the Lakeland facility can't ship controlled substances until the appeal is sorted out.    Cardinal, based in Dublin, Ohio, said it activated contingency plans earlier this month ""and will continue to endeavor to meet our customers' needs with minimal disruption from our other distribution centers.""    The contingency plans involve shipping controlled drugs to customers in the Southeast U.S. from alternative facilities in Mississippi or North Carolina. Analysts have said the plans could add transportation costs to Cardinal and delay deliveries.    The suspension of the DEA license means the Lakeland facility is blocked from shipping controlled medications like the pain drug oxycodone to thousands of pharmacies, hospitals and other health-care providers. Cardinal, the nation's No. 2 drug distributor by sales after McKesson Corp., can still ship noncontrolled medications, which include most prescription drugs, and supplies such as surgical packs.    The DEA also suspended last month the controlled-medication licenses of four Florida pharmacies, including two owned and operated by CVS Caremark Corp. CVS won a temporary, administrative stay on Wednesday to keep dispensing controlled medications after an appeals court denied the pharmacy chain's request for a preliminary injunction.    The DEA took action against the Lakeland facility last month while accusing Cardinal of not doing enough to stop oxycodone abuse. Cardinal has said that it supports the DEA's efforts but also disagreed that it wasn't doing enough.    A U.S. District Court Judge ruled in late February that the government acted properly in trying to cut off shipments of oxycodone from the Lakeland site. Cardinal appealed that ruling in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.     Case: l:l7-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1967-72 Filed: 07/23/19 72 of 142. PagelD$aged90i62    DEA searches Fla. Walgreens in painkiller probe    CURT ANDERSON, AP Legal Affairs Writer Updated 3:01 p.m., Friday, April 6, 2012    MIAMI (AP) � Federal drug agents have searched six Walgreens pharmacies and a company distribution center in Florida as part of an investigation into prescription painkiller drug abuse, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration officials said Friday.    The distribution center in Jupiter and the six pharmacies � two in Fort Pierce and one each in Hudson, Port Richey, Fort Myers and Oviedo � all showed signs of suspiciously high distribution of the highly addictive drug oxycodone, a DEA investigator wrote in an affidavit for the search warrants.    Such large amounts, investigator Marjorie Milan wrote, indicates ""a pharmacy that fills prescriptions issued by physicians at pain clinics and/or a pharmacy which services primarily drug-seeking individuals who abuse the medication.""    The searches for pharmacy records conducted Wednesday are the latest in a crackdown by federal and state authorities on ""pill mills"" and other illegal sources of prescription drugs in Florida, which has become the nation's leading source of oxycodone and similar drugs. The DEA says that prescription drug abuse now exceeds abuse of all illegal drugs combined, except marijuana.    Michael Polzin, a spokesman for Deerfield, Ill.-based Walgreens, said it is cooperating in the investigation.    8/14/2012     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1967-72  Filed:  07/23/19 73 of 142.  PagelD^J^|^L2    Earlier this year, the DEA moved to suspend the sale of similar controlled substances at two CVS pharmacies in the Orlando area, and the shipment of them from Cardinal Health Inc.'s Lakeland, Fla.-based center that supplied the stores. A federal appeals court recently upheld those suspensions.    DEA records cited in the Walgreens affidavit show sharp increases in oxycodone purchases at each of the locations. For example, the pharmacy in Fort Myers went from selling 95,800 units of oxycodone in 2009 to more than 2.1 million units in 2011 � good for 67 percent of all the oxycodone purchased by pharmacies in that same zip code in 2011.    In the first two months of this year, the DEA added, 53 Walgreens pharmacies are listed in the agency's top 100 purchasers of oxycodone. In 2009, none were on the list.    Earlier this year, the DEA released figures showing that Florida may be losing its distinction as the nation's leading illicit source for painkillers because of the ongoing law enforcement crackdown and several new laws. Florida also last year began operating a prescription drug tracking system and database aimed at combating illegal diversion of the drugs.    About 85 people, including at least 13 doctors, have been arrested in South Florida over the past year on pill mill-related charges, according to federal prosecutors.    8/14/2012     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1967-72  Filed:  07/23/19 74 of 142.  PagelD #: 176902    The DEA's prescription drug policy saves many lives    Wall Street Journal    By: Peter Bensinger and Robert L. DuPont    Scott Gottlieb's ""The DEA's War on Pharmacies�and Pain Patients"" (op-ed, March 23) hardly tells the true story of prescription drug abuse and the government's response. In the current Cardinal Health case, the Drug Enforcement Administration discovered numerous oxycodone transactions that greatly exceeded the ""suspicious order"" criteria in the law and were not halted or reported to the DEA. Cardinal Health was fined $34 million in 2008 for similar violations.    Last July, the Florida legislature declared a public-health emergency�not because of a shortage of medicine, but because of increased overdose deaths caused by prescription opioids. Last year 25 distributors provided over 570 million dosage units of oxycodone in Florida alone, with Cardinal Health accounting for 25%.    Dr. Gottlieb thinks transferring DEA's responsibilities to the FDA would be a good idea, yet the FDA's record when it comes to regulating controlled substances is not good. In 1996, DEA asked FDA to schedule Soma (carisoprodol), a muscle relaxant abused by opiate addicts. In 2009, 13 years later/the FDA granted permission to schedule the drug. In 2004, the DEA asked the FDA to reschedule hydrocodone products (Vicodin, Lortab, etc.), The FDA responded four years later but did not agree to tighten the controls on what continues to be America's most frequently prescribed opioid associated with significant overdose deaths. A bill currently in Congress, if passed, will accomplish this long overdue action.    Prescription-drug overdose deaths now exceed U.S. motor-vehicle fatalities. The only federal agency that has confronted the unlawful diversion of these drugs is the DEA. Shifting regulatory control from the DEA to the FDA would accomplish nothing, but would add to the problem.    The DEA represents the unspoken interests of tens of thousands of victims harmed or killed each year by prescription drug abuse. The DEA's enforcement actions in Florida are clearly in the public interest, and its regulatory authority should not be diminished, but strongly supported.     0    �    0    �,'MJ''-"" *-V' '.<;"":�.' ;t*.j} -'Ur'^P -*-S*i;Tpp 50 Pharmacies. ..'-<��  .V ./,-' V''�'-'r'- <��:>-''-.<-.-,'�� �* �;T.1^-'^!*r)fe.-'v..?- i#�saiesofbxycodS*ne-15mg r^cfelSTOItfe)-:- V^'S'^""^^ 'B >           Rank    J   Buyer's DEA Number 1�*   '      .""""�<�-""    *fjt*       -       (.**-�<,�    ',.,      �.��*�    * o*%      jA,*           '      -V&>V-w     **XSl*>~   Buyer's Name-   x'�!-- ,   , > f+  ;   ""U     U<"""" ""* ~ ^""I   %02'*       -         *�""�,.*'""-""�'          y   Buyer's County -.*�"", *   {4                                  �4            5^,4""   - tr      ~  B -<�� Buyer's City if-    ""   Buyer's State �   Buyer's'-Zip A   s   -Totaf J    1       <NOX   KNOXVILLE   TN   37919   245,000    2   t    <vJCHOFtAGE   ANCHORAGE   AK   99508   213,600    3   F    SUSSEX   SEAFORD   DE   19973   194,600    4   F    HILLSBOROUGH   TAMPA   FL   33613   177,300    5   E I    3UCKS   BENSALEM   PA   19020   158,300    *   6     DAVIDSON   ANTIOCH   TN   37013   150,000    7     BROWARD   FORT LAUDERDALE   FL   33309   148,000    8     MANATEE   BRADENTON   FL   34202   145,900    9     CABELL   HUNTINGTON   WV   25701   145,400    10       BREVARD   PALM BAY   FL   32905   138,000    11     SUSSEX   MILFORD   DE   19963   136,100    12     SAINT LUCIE   FORT PIERCE   FL   34981   127,900    13     ORANGE   ORLANDO   FL   32819   126,600    14     MARICOPA   TEMPE   AZ   85284   125,500    15     SEMINOLE   CASSELBERRY   FL   32730   125.500    16     LEE   FORT MYERS   FL   33907   124,100    17     BROWARD   FORT LAUDERDALE   FL   33314   117,400    18     WESTMORELAND   IRWIN   PA   15642   110,200    19       BROWARD   FORT LAUDERDALE   FL   33317   108,700    20       NEW CASTLE   BEAR   DE   19701   103,400    21       SARASOTA   SARASOTA   FL   34233   101,100    22     ORANGE   ORLANDO   FL   32806   99,500    23       STRAFFORD   ROCHESTER   NH   03867   99,000    24       CALVERT   PRINCE FREDERICK   MD   20678   98,900    25       JOHNSON   LENEXA   KS   66215   97,600    26       ORANGE   ORLANDO   FL   32819   96,500    27       GREENVILLE   GREENVILLE   SC   29605   94,700    28       MILWAUKEE   MILWAUKEE   Wl   53222   94,500    29       SUSSEX   LEWES   DE   19958   93,600    30       BALTIMORE   PARKVILLE   MD   21234   91,500    31       MANATEE   BRADENTON   FL   34205   90,600    321       SURRY   ELKIN   NC   28621   89,300    33         BERNALILLO   ALBUQUERQUE   NM   87108   88,800    34       NEW CASTLE   NEWARK   DE   19713   88,700    Page 1 of 2    Drug Enforcement Administration, Office of Diversion Control, Pharmaceutical Investigations Section, Targeting and Analysis Unit    Date Prepared: 04/03/2012 Source: ARCOS    Tmmmmmmsmmm     0    0    �    **4-*-�V*'   Rank    <""*   A              +4       ""*   Buyer's DEA Number   \w *   v.    f      -      -   4 ^,     v    -^ V�* y >�   -M     -4          7�            4        -     )   -..

PagelD #: 176968    Suggested Questions a Distributor should ask prior to shipping controlled    substances.    This list of questions is not intended to be all inclusive nor should it be interpreted that every situation or registrant activity is covered. This questionnaire is provided to assist the distributor to formulate a better understanding of who their customers are and whether or not they should sell to them controlled substances. It is incumbent upon you, the distributors, to ensure that sales to your customers are for legitimate purposes. It is further incumbent upon you to identify illicit or suspicious activities which may result in the diversion of controlled substances.    The use of this questionnaire should not be construed in any manner to be a mechanism or means that you have fully met the criteria and actions required by 21 USC 823 or other state and federal laws that are applicable.    Possible questions for a pharmacy:    �    Does the pharmacy fill prescriptions via the Internet? If so, is the pharmacy registered with the DEA under the Ryan Haight Act?    �    Is this a mail order pharmacy (tills prescriptions for insurance, etc.)?    Note: A pharmacist may claim to be mail order pharmacy but may actually be operating as an Internet pharmacy. Do not accept the response to this question at face value.    Is the pharmacy licensed in all states for which it mails or fills prescriptions?    Does the pharmacy report to all states that have prescription monitoring programs    in which their customers reside and to whom they dispense?    Does the pharmacy provide services for any specialty customers such as Long    Term Health Care, Hospice Centers, Assisted Care Living Facilities, etc.?    Does the pharmacy have staff or a private firm that solicits practitioners to get    more business?    What is the pharmacy's ratio of controlled vs. non-controlled orders?    Does the pharmacy order a full variety of controlled substances and are they fairly    evenly dispersed? If not, why the disparity?    What are the hours of operation of the pharmacy?    Does the pharmacy offer a full assortment of sundries to its customers (e.g.,    aspirin, snacks, cosmetics, etc.)?    Does the pharmacy have security guards on the premises? If so, why?    What methods of payment does the pharmacy accept (cash, insurance, Medicaid,    and in what ratios)?    Who is the pharmacy's primary supplier?    Does the pharmacy order from other suppliers as well? If so, why and what    controlled substances?    If this is a new account, why does the pharmacy want you to be their supplier?    lof3    September 12, 2012     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1967-72 Filed: 07/23/19 141 of 142. PagelD #: 176969    �    If you are not the only supplier, what controlled substances will the pharmacy be ordering from you, in what quantities, in what time frame, and will they be ordering these same products from other suppliers?    �    What ratio will you be supplying compared to other suppliers?    �    Does the pharmacy fill prescriptions for out of state customers? If so, for how many out of state customers does the pharmacy fill (ratio or approximate number)?    �    If the pharmacy fills prescriptions for Pain Management or other specialty practitioners (diet, oncology, etc.), is the pharmacist comfortable with the prescribing practices of the practitioner?    �    Has the pharmacist questioned or been uncomfortable with, the prescribing practices of any practitioner?    �    Has the pharmacy ever refused to fill prescriptions for a practitioner? If so, why and who?    �    Are there particular practitioners who constitute most of the prescriptions it fills? Who are these practitioners (Name and DEA registration number)?    �    Does the pharmacy have any exclusive contracts, agreements, arrangements, etc., with any particular practitioner, business group, investors, etc.? If so, explain those arrangements and/or obtain copies of those agreements.    �    Is the pharmacist comfortable enough with the prescribing practices of any or all practitioners for which they fill, to stake their professional livelihood on it?    �    Does the pharmacy supply, order for, or sell to any practitioners or other pharmacies?    �    How does the pharmacy sell/transfer controlled substances to other pharmacies or practitioners? Via a prescription, sales invoice, or DEA Form-222? (Transfer by prescriptions is not authorized).    Possible questions for a practitioner:    �    What is the practitioner's specialty, if any (family practice, oncology, geriatrics, pain management, etc.)?    �    Do the controlled substances being ordered correspond to his specialty or the treatment he provides?    �    What method of payment does the practitioner accept (cash, insurance, Medicare) and what is the ratio of each?    �    Has the practitioner ever been disciplined by any state or federal authority?    �    How many patients does the practitioner see each day? What is his weekly average?    �    Does the practitioner prescribe as well as dispense?    �    Why does the practitioner prefer to dispense as opposed to prescribe?    �    Who was the practitioner's previous supplier? Are they still ordering from this supplier? If not, why are they looking for a new supplier?    �    Do the hours of operation and the facility accommodate the type of practice being conducted?    �    Does the practitioner's office have security guards on-site? If so, why?    2 of 3    September 12, 2012     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1967-72 Filed: 07/23/19 142 of 142.  PagelD #: 176970    Are all applicable state, federal, local licenses current and are they issued for the registered address at which the practitioner is practicing? Does the practitioner see out of state patients? If so,    o   From what states,    o   How many,    o   Approximate ratio of out of state compared to local, and    o   Why, specifically, they travel so far to see him?    Can the practitioner provide a blank copy of an agreement which they enter into    with a patient, specifying the course of treatment, the patient rights and    responsibilities, and reasons for termination of treatment?    Does the practitioner conduct random unannounced drug testing?    What measures does the practitioner employ and/or monitor to prevent addiction    and diversion of controlled substances?    Are there more than one practitioner dispensing controlled substances from the    registered location?    Do you order for just yourself or for the whole clinic?    What controlled substances are you currently dispensing? (If only one or two    controlled substances are being ordered, have the practitioner fully explain why    he administers or dispenses only these specific controlled substances).    In what dosage levels is the practitioner dispensing (2 tablets, 4 times a day, for    30 days, or 90,120,240 a week, month).    Does the practitioner prescribe as well as dispense to his patients?    Does the practitioner prescribe the same controlled substances as were dispensed    to the patient?    How many patients is the practitioner presently treating (day, week, and month)?    Should you have any additional questions, concerns, or issues beyond what has been presented; it is strongly recommended you contact your local DEA Office.    3 of 3 September 12, 2012    �        � "
